Content-based image retrieval for fabric images: A survey,"In recent years, a great deal of research has been conducted in the area of fabric image retrieval, especially the identification and classification of visual features. One of the challenges associated with the domain of content-based image retrieval (CBIR) is the semantic gap between low-level visual features and high-level human perceptions. Generally, CBIR includes two main components, namely feature extraction and similarity measurement. Therefore, this research aims to determine the content-based image retrieval for fabric using feature extraction techniques grouped into traditional methods and convolutional neural networks (CNN). Traditional descriptors deal with low-level features, while CNN addresses the high-level, called semantic features. Traditional descriptors have the advantage of shorter computation time and reduced system requirements. Meanwhile, CNN descriptors, which handle high-level features tailored to human perceptions, deal with large amounts of data and require a great deal of computation time. In general, the features of a CNN's fully connected layers are used for matching query and database images. In several studies, the extracted features of the CNN's convolutional layer were used for image retrieval. At the end of the CNN layer, hash codes are added to reduce search time. © 2021 Institute of Advanced Engineering and Science.

Autocorrection of lung boundary on 3D CT lung cancer images,"Lung cancer in men has the highest mortality rate among all types of cancer. Juxta-pleural and juxta-vascular are the most common nodules located on the lung surface. A computer aided detection (CADe) system is effective for assisting radiologists in diagnosing lung nodules. However, the lung segmentation step requires sophisticated methods when juxta-pleural and juxta-vascular nodules are present. Fast computational time and low error in covering nodule areas are the aims of this study. The proposed method consists of five stages, namely ground truth (GT) extraction, data preparation, tracheal extraction, separation of lung fusion and lung border correction. The used data consist of 57 3D CT lung cancer images taken from selected LIDC-IDRI dataset. These nodules are determined as the outer areas labeled by four radiologists. The proposed method achieves the fastest computational time of 0.32 s per slice or 60 times faster than that of conventional adaptive border marching (ABM). Moreover, it produces under segmentation of nodule value as low as 14.6%. It indicates that the proposed method has a potential to be embedded in the lung CADe system to cover pleural juxta and vascular nodule areas in lung segmentation. © 2019 The Authors",Boundary correction; CADe system; Lung; Segmentation 
Developing Machine Learning Framework to Classify Harmonized System Code. Case Study: Indonesian Customs,"Directorate General of Customs and Excise (DGCE), an Indonesian Government agency under the Ministry of Finance, is responsible for ensuring importer or exporter classify their declared goods based on the Harmonized System Code (HS Code). This study aims to find an optimal machine learning framework to classify goods into their HS Code based on the challenges DGCE faced, such as mixed language with an inconsistent pattern of goods descriptions, imbalance multiclass HS Code, and some additional categorical variables. Refer to some previous studies that propose some machine learning models to predict the HS Code based on goods descriptions. This study tries to make some improvements and adjustments in line with the previously mentioned challenges faced by DGCE. Some preprocessing tasks were performed, such as dealing with abbreviations, misspellings, the varying pattern of goods description, and translating Indonesian words into English. One Hot Coding (OHC) is applied to encode nominal and categorical variables. To make features from goods descriptions, we choose Term Frequency-Inverse Document Frequency (TF-IDF) combined with bigrams. As a result, our models show that Random Forest got an F1-score of 79.60% when classifying the HS Code's first four digits, and Multinomial NB got an F1-score of 72.74% when classifying the HS Code's entire digits. Compared to the baseline paper, those scores are 11.26% and 11.36% higher, respectively. © 2021 IEEE.",HS code; Indonesian customs; machine learning Decision trees; Machine learning; Optimal systems; Text processing; Categorical variables; F1 scores; Government agencies; Machine learning models; Multinomials; One hot coding; System codes; Term frequencyinverse document frequency (TF-IDF); Codes (symbols)
Suction-based Grasp Point Estimation in Cluttered Environment for Robotic Manipulator Using Deep Learning-based Affordance Map,"Perception and manipulation tasks for robotic manipulators involving highly-cluttered objects have become increasingly in-demand for achieving a more efficient problem solving method in modern industrial environments. But, most of the available methods for performing such cluttered tasks failed in terms of performance, mainly due to inability to adapt to the change of the environment and the handled objects. Here, we propose a new, near real-time approach to suction-based grasp point estimation in a highly cluttered environment by employing an affordance-based approach. Compared to the state-of-the-art, our proposed method offers two distinctive contributions. First, we use a modified deep neural network backbone for the input of the semantic segmentation, to classify pixel elements of the input red, green, blue and depth (RGBD) channel image which is then used to produce an affordance map, a pixel-wise probability map representing the probability of a successful grasping action in those particular pixel regions. Later, we incorporate a high speed semantic segmentation to the system, which makes our solution have a lower computational time. This approach does not need to have any prior knowledge or models of the objects since it removes the step of pose estimation and object recognition entirely compared to most of the current approaches and uses an assumption to grasp first then recognize later, which makes it possible to have an object-agnostic property. The system was designed to be used for household objects, but it can be easily extended to any kind of objects provided that the right dataset is used for training the models. Experimental results show the benefit of our approach which achieves a precision of 88.83%, compared to the 83.4% precision of the current state-of-the-art. © 2021, Institute of Automation, Chinese Academy of Sciences and Springer-Verlag GmbH Germany, part of Springer Nature.",blue and depth (RGBD) channel image; cluttered environment; Grasping point estimation; green; household objects; red; semantic segmentation Deep neural networks; Flexible manipulators; Image segmentation; Industrial manipulators; Industrial robots; Object recognition; Pixels; Problem solving; Robotics; Semantics; Cluttered environments; Computational time; Industrial environments; Manipulation task; Probability maps; Problem Solving methods; Robotic manipulators; Semantic segmentation; Deep learning
Computer aided diagnosis for thyroid cancer system based on internal and external characteristics,"Background and aims: Thyroid cancer is one of the fastest growing cancers worldwide. Thyroid ultrasound images are diagnosed based on several characteristics to determine the malignancy of the nodule. The characteristics are divided into two, i.e. external characteristics and internal characteristics. A computer-aided diagnosis (CADx) is necessary to assist radiologists in analysing these characteristics more objectively. Methods: Firstly, a pre-processing step was applied to remove label and reduce speckle noise by applying adaptive median filter followed by bilateral filter. Secondly, active contour and morphology operation were applied to segment the nodules. Subsequently, geometric and texture features were extracted. In the final step, multilayer perceptron was used to classify internal characteristics while support vector machine was used for classifying external characteristics. Results: The sensitivity, specificity and accuracy of nodule classification based on analysis of external characteristics were 100%, 95.45% and 97.78%, respectively, whereas classification results based on internal characteristics were 95.35%, 90.91% and 94.44%, respectively. Conclusion: A computer-aided diagnosis (CADx) for thyroid cancer system based on analysis of external and internal characteristics has been developed. The sensitivity, specificity and level of accuracy for both characteristics showed that the proposed system was reliable to assist radiologist in classifying thyroid nodules. © 2019 The Authors",Computed aided diagnosis; External characteristics; Internal characteristics; Thyroid cancer 
Analysis of Retinal Nerve Fiber Layer for Classification of Glaucoma,"Glaucoma is the second leading causes of blindness beside of cataracts. In the glaucoma examination, determining the disease is very difficult since the symptoms are difficult to find. The ophthalmologists usually use the disc damage likelihood score (DDLS) in examining the optic nerve damage which is very complicated. Glaucoma can also be detected by looking at damage of retinal nerve fiber layer (RNFL) which is characterized by the loss of nerve fiber around the optic nerve head (ONH). However, manual examination became less effective and less efficient since it required specific skills and needed more time to finish the examination. This research aimed to develop a scheme for detecting glaucoma disease based on retinal nerve fiber layer features. First order statistic feature was used to recognize the characteristic of RNFL. These features were mean, standard deviation, skewness, energy, entropy, smoothness, min and max. The info gain feature selection was used to select features with the most dominant influence. Then, the selected feature was used to classify the image into a normal class or glaucoma. Retinal image classification results between normal class and glaucoma using radial basis function network (RBFN) classifier obtained accuracy of 90.00%, sensitivity of 93.33%, and specificity of 86.67%. These results indicated that the proposed method could assist the ophthalmologist in early detection of glaucoma disease on retinal fundus image based on retinal nerve fiber layer features. © 2021 IEEE.",blindness; glaucoma; RBFN classifier; retina disease; RNFL characteristic Damage detection; Feature extraction; Fibers; Image classification; Ophthalmology; Radial basis function networks; Glaucoma disease; Likelihood score; Nerve damage; Nerve fibers; Network classifiers; Optic nerve; Radial base function network classifier; Retina disease; Retinal nerve fiber layer characteristic; Retinal nerve fiber layers; Eye protection

Night-to-Day Road Scene Translation Using Generative Adversarial Network with Structural Similarity Loss for Night Driving Safety,"Inadequate road infrastructures in developing countries, such as road lighting, is a real life problem affecting their transportation system. A poor road lighting hinders the ability of drivers to perceive the road conditions as well as its objects which may lead to the accident. We address a problem of synthesizing day-time appearance from the night-time road scene using loss-modified generative adversarial network. Our approach basically makes a balance between domain regularization and human perceptual restoration. By taking the night-time image into our enhanced adversarial network, which employs structural similarity loss, we increase its visibility so that the driver can clearly see the road scene like they are driving during the day-time. Experimental results show the benefit of our approach for enhancing the visibility of the night-time view of the road, measured by the image quality metrics. © 2021, The Author(s), under exclusive license to Springer Nature Switzerland AG.",Deep learning; Generative adversarial networks (GAN); Traffic accidents 
Measurement and Classification Retinal Blood Vessel Tortuosity in Digital Fundus Images,"Analysis and detection of retinal blood vessels structure changes is the most important for diagnosing and detecting retinal diseases. Retinal blood vessels are normally straight or curved gently, but they tend to dilate and expand into twisting with age or the number of retinal disease. Tortuosity is a qualitative parameter used by ophthalmologist to show how blood vessels tortuos such as mild, moderate, severe and extreme as the analysis result remain subjective. To establish the relationship between tortuosity and vascular pathology requires quantitative measurement of tortuosity. This research developed a computer aided diagnosis (CAD) to detect retinal blood vessels before measure the blood vessels tortuosity and classify them. A method of morphological reconstruction is proposed to detect retinal blood vessels. Retinal blood vessel tortuosity was calculated using relative length variation method to classify retinal images. This research is conducted two types classification using K nearest neighbor. The first classification is normal and tortuosity classes. The second classification is moderate and severe tortuosity classes. The evaluation result for retinal blood vessel detection is obtained accuracy of 96.2%. Calculation of retinal blood vessel tortuosity based on relative length variation method because it has the best correlation of 0.892 to grading. The results of retinal blood vessel tortuosity classification between normal and tortuosity classes is obtained the best accuracy of KNN by 93%. The classification between moderate and severe tortuosity classes using KNN obtains accuracy of 100%.

Indonesian Sentiment Analysis: An Experimental Study of Four Kernel Functions on SVM Algorithm with TF-IDF,"Recently, Indonesian sentiment analysis is a hot research field, especially for twitter data. Many approaches can be used to classify people's sentiment on Twitter. One of the best methods in sentiment analysis is machine learning. SVM is a machine learning algorithm that has good performance. However, some of the findings of SVM research have different results, which are no better than other algorithms. It is because each study uses a different SVM configuration. Kernel functions on SVM play an essential role in improving SVM performance. Choosing the sui table Kernel function is also crucial for every particular application of SVM. Therefore, to address the problem, we compared four kernel functions on SVM with TF-IDF, such as Polynomial, Sigmoid, Linear, and Radial Basis Function (RBF) kernel. TF-IDF is employed as a feature extraction and selection to improve SVM performance. We used 4000 tweets about omnibus law issues in Indonesia, and 10-fold cross-validation and confusion matrix were employed to validate and evaluate our models. Based on the experimental results, the RBF kernel function on SVM+TF-IDF using 2000 features achieved the best performance of all feature tests in accuracy, precision, recall, and f-measure with value of 96.61%, 96.70%, 96.58%, 96.60%, respectively. Besides, the RBF kernel function obtained high performance when using low dimensionality of the feature. Meanwhile, the Linear kernel function reached the best performance when using high dimensionality of the feature. © 2020 IEEE.",kernel functions; Sentiment Analysis; support vector machine; tf-idf; twitter data Feature extraction; Industrial economics; Machine learning; Sentiment analysis; Social networking (online); Turing machines; 10-fold cross-validation; Confusion matrices; Feature extraction and selection; High dimensionality; Linear kernel functions; Low dimensionality; Radial Basis Function(RBF); RBF kernel function; Learning algorithms

Accuracy Improvement of Object Selection in Gaze Gesture Application using Deep Learning,"Gaze-based interaction is a crucial research area. Gaze gesture provides faster interaction between a user and a computer application because people naturally look at the object of interest before taking any other actions. Spontaneous gaze-gesture-based application uses gaze-gesture as an input modality without performing any calibration. The conventional eye tracking systems have a problem with low accuracy. In general, data captured by eye tracker contains errors and noise within gaze position signal. The errors and noise affect the performance of object selection in gaze gesture based application that controls digital contents on the display using smooth-pursuit eye movement. The conventional object selection method suffers from low accuracy (<80%). In this paper, we addressed this accuracy problem with a novel approach using deep learning. We exploited deep learning power to recognize the pattern of eye-gaze data. Long Short Term Memory (LSTM) is a deep learning architecture based on recurrent neural network (RNN). We used LSTM to perform object selection task. The dataset consisted of 34 participants taken from previous study of object selection technique of gaze gesture-based application. Our experimental results show that the proposed method achieved 96.17% of accuracy. In future, our result may be used as a guidance for developing gaze gesture application. © 2020 IEEE.",Deep Learning; Eye Tracking; Gaze Gesture; LSTM Eye movements; Eye tracking; Long short-term memory; Accuracy Improvement; Accuracy problems; Eye tracking systems; Gaze-based interaction; Input modalities; Learning architectures; Recurrent neural network (RNN); Smooth pursuit eye movement; Deep learning
Sliding variance and data range for lightweight sports activity recognition with fusion of modalities,"This research develops a novel lightweight sport activity detection system using time series data of the accelerometer sensors embedded in two modalities, the smartphone and smartwatch. This research focuses on the lightweight exercises, more specifically, jumping jack, push up, sit up, and squat jump. Such activities are chosen for two reasons; the smartphone is now accessible for many persons, and the lightweight exercises are deemed to be easily completed in daily basis for everyone. Our proposed algorithm includes two novel feature extraction methods, i.e. sliding variance and data range, combined with a digital filter and data clipping methods. The results of feature extraction processes were classified using a combination of k-NN and DTW algorithms. The classification results are subsequently compared with the-state-of-the-art algorithms, i.e. LMNN and Naïve Bayes algorithms. The final results imply the merge of k-NN and DTW algorithms (k = 1) with data range method achieves the highest accuracy. The average accuracy for this method is 97.4%, with the processing time of 0.86 s. Thus, the result of counting activity method was acceptable with average values 80% for the whole movement by using two sensor accelerometers. © 2018 The Authors",Dynamic Time Warping; kNearest Neighbor; Large Margin Nearest Neighbor; Lightweight sport activity; Naïve Bayes 
Application of Artificial Potential Field for Coverage Control with Collision Avoidance Under Sensing Constraints,"In multi-agent coverage control, the Voronoi diagram optimization strategy is widely used. However, the limitation of sensing radius makes Voronoi diagram optimization strategy not suitable to implement. Moreover, when the agent’s dimension and obstacles are considered, the Voronoi diagram cannot deal further due to the collision that may occur. Considering these limitations, power diagram optimization strategy is used. To deal with obstacles, artificial potential field strategy is combined with the power diagram. Despite its simplicity, the numerical study shows that the proposed scheme of coverage control works well under sensing constraints even with the presence of obstacles. The proposed strategy is convergent to the objective without collision with obstacles as well as among the agents. © 2020, Brazilian Society for Automatics--SBA.",Artificial potential field; Coverage control; Obstacle avoidance; Power diagram; Voronoi diagram Computational geometry; Graphic methods; Multi agent systems; Artificial potential fields; Collision with obstacle; Coverage control; Optimization strategy; Power diagrams; Sensing constraints; Sensing radius; Voronoi diagrams; Collision avoidance
Automated Detection of Plasmodium Ovale and Malariae Species on Microscopic Thin Blood Smear Images,"Malaria is caused by Plasmodium and transmitted by female Anopheles mosquitoes bite. Early detection of malaria has been performed using microscopic thin blood smear images. Even so, in 2014, as many as 321 million times microscopic examination, there were frequent misdiagnosis caused by human factors. Region of Interest (RoI) in image processing is part of the image that has the highest information. The precise determination of the RoI area can make the computer-based identification process work more efficiently, contribute better to the system, and also eliminate objects that are perceived to interfere with the whole process. This study aims to detect parasites by determining the RoI area of two species of Plasmodium Ovale and Plasmodium Malariae. The working principle of detection is using adaptive thresholding, colour segmentation between green channel (G) with hue channel (H) from HSV colour space, and some morphological operation techniques. The data used are digital microscopic images of thin blood smear. This research achieves the sensitivity level of 91.6% and positive predictive value (PPV) of 89.1%.

Enumeration of Plasmodium Parasites on Thin Blood Smear Digital Microscopic Images,"An automated parasite detection is one of the challenges in computer vision and medicine field. Recently, an automated detection system became necessary in order to assist the parasitologist in detecting parasite. However, the development of automated parasite detection had several challenges. Mostly, previous research studies were conducted with the homogeny dataset. Hence, it will become a problem if the research was conducted with various dataset. According to those facts, this study proposed a scheme for detecting Plasmodium parasites. In this study, 46 thin blood smear digital microscopic images of Plasmodium Falciparum with several kinds of pixel intensity were used. The proposed method started by normalizing the data. The normalization result was then segmented by using Otsu thresholding and some operations of morphological operation. Based on the segmentation result, parasite candidate detection was done by storing the location of an object in segmentation result and labeling the object by using BLOB analysis. The result of detection process produced high number of false positive. To reduce the number of false positive, feature extraction process followed by classification process was conducted. Several texture features such as histogram, GLCM and GLRLM were used to extract information of parasite. Classification process was conducted by applying several kernels of SVM classifier. According to the evaluation process, the proposed method has better performance than previous study and successfully distinguish parasite and non-parasite by using the cubic kernel of SVM with accuracy, sensitivity, specificity, PPV and NPV of 97.4%, 100%, 94.8%, 95.1% and 100%, respectively. These results indicated that the proposed scheme is proper in order to assist the expert in detecting Plasmodium parasites effectively. © 2019 IEEE.",detection algorithm; malaria; microscopic images; Plasmodium parasites Automation; Blood; Embedded systems; Mathematical morphology; Support vector machines; Textures; Classification process; Detection algorithm; Digital microscopic images; malaria; Microscopic image; Morphological operations; Plasmodium falciparum; Plasmodium parasites; Classification (of information)

Deep learning-based Anomaly Detection on Surveillance Videos: Recent Advances,"Surveillance cameras number keep increasing from year to year, in 2017 alone estimated 106 million new CCTV installed. Surveillance cameras are installed to widen surveillance coverage in order to detect anomalies. Conventionally, detecting anomalies through surveillance cameras are using human observers. The increasing number of surveillance cameras installed is increasing the need for an automatic system to replace unreliable human observer. Thus an intelligent computer vision-based system to detect anomalies need to be developed. The goal of this system is to provide a warning to the first responder accurately and as fast as possible while the system is running all the time. The faster the response of the first responder, the better chance of an anomaly to be resolved. Deep learning based method has been proposed to solve anomaly detection on videos. Anomaly detected is composed of a set of violent and non-violent crimes with high impact in society. To increase the accuracy of previous system to detect anomalies in condition that resembles real life situation, multiple processes need to be combined.

User profile correlation-based similarity (UPCSim) algorithm in movie recommendation system,"Collaborative filtering is one of the most widely used recommendation system approaches. One issue in collaborative filtering is how to use a similarity algorithm to increase the accuracy of the recommendation system. Most recently, a similarity algorithm that combines the user rating value and the user behavior value has been proposed. The user behavior value is obtained from the user score probability in assessing the genre data. The problem with the algorithm is it only considers genre data for capturing user behavior value. Therefore, this study proposes a new similarity algorithm – so-called User Profile Correlation-based Similarity (UPCSim) – that examines the genre data and the user profile data, namely age, gender, occupation, and location. All the user profile data are used to find the weights of the similarities of user rating value and user behavior value. The weights of both similarities are obtained by calculating the correlation coefficients between the user profile data and the user rating or behavior values. An experiment shows that the UPCSim algorithm outperforms the previous algorithm on recommendation accuracy, reducing MAE by 1.64% and RMSE by 1.4%. © 2021, The Author(s).",Collaborative filtering; UPCSim; User behavior value; User rating value 
Recommendation algorithm using clustering-based upcsim (Cb-upcsim),"One of the well-known recommendation systems is memory-based collaborative filtering that utilizes similarity metrics. Recently, the similarity metrics have taken into account the user rating and user behavior scores. The user behavior score indicates the user preference in each product type (genre). The added user behavior score to the similarity metric results in more complex com-putation. To reduce the complex computation, we combined the clustering method and user behavior score-based similarity. The clustering method applies k-means clustering by determination of the number of clusters using the Silhouette Coefficient. Whereas the user behavior score-based similarity utilizes User Profile Correlation-based Similarity (UPCSim). The experimental results with the MovieLens 100k dataset showed a faster computation time of 4.16 s. In addition, the Mean Ab-solute Error (MAE) and Root Mean Square Error (RMSE) values decreased by 1.88% and 1.46% com-pared to the baseline algorithm. © 2021 by the authors.

Designing a tourism recommendation system using a hybrid method (Collaborative Filtering and Content-Based Filtering),"A recommendation system is an application model based on observations of the customers circumstances and desires. The recommendation system can be applied in various fields, one of which is tourism. By utilizing a recommendation system, tourism can introduce and promote its tourism to the wider community. In the recommendation system, several methods are used to support how the system works in producing information. This papers uses the Hybrid (Collaborative Filtering Content-Based Filtering) method and the Nearest Neighbor (NN) algorithm. This method has a weakness when an item does not have a rating at all. Therefore, it needs a method that can overcome the weaknesses of the method. We implement a hybrid method, which combines several methods in the recommendation system to produce recommendation items under the users wishes. In addition, this system will use Whatsapp Messenger as a promotional medium.

Automated Item Generation: Model and Development Technique,"The development of Computer Assisted Assessment (CAA) has helped the assessment process. Some of the advantages offered by these tools are effectivity and speed. But there are still obstacles in the process of compiling the items. Therefore, we need tools to overcome this problem. Automated Item Generation (AIG) is a tool to generate questions using computer devices. Several models and techniques in AIG had been developed. AIG research is grouped into 2 models i.e. the framework model and special model. In the previous study, the AIG was divided into two approaches, automatic and semi-automatic. Several techniques were developed to produce high-quality and variety of items. Each technique has advantages and disadvantages in generating items. Thus, there is still a need for developing AIG to answer the challenges that have not been resolved in the previous study. This paper presents a literature review to identify a specific problem in each model and technique especially for mathematic and non-verbal items, validity and reliability of the items, and the schema or infrastructure presented to generate the items. This paper also gives possible suggestions on how to make an improvement the items generated to be better in the future. © 2020 IEEE.",AIG Model; AIG Technique; Automated Item Generation; Computer Assisted Assessment Computer science; Computers; Electrical engineering; Mathematical techniques; Assessment process; Computer assisted assessment; Computer device; Development technique; Framework models; Literature reviews; Semi-automatics; Specific problems; Automation
Automatic Question Generator System Conceptual Model for Mathematic and Geometry Parallel Question Replication,"Weaknesses in the paper assessment process have been able to overcome using the Computer Assisted Assessment (CAA) objective question. The weakness that can be overcome is the reduction in time for correction and the process of handling thousands of participants simultaneously. However, the process of preparing objective questions is still constrained by providing parallel questions. Parallel questions are made so that each examinee gets a different question but has the same level of difficulty. Making parallel questions manually requires expensive costs and the consistency of the difficulty level must be the same. Some researchers propose an Automatic Question Generation (AQG) system to overcome these problems. In this study an AQG system will be developed to make parallel questions for the material tested at each school level. The process of previous generating questions that can only detect text and numeric variables, will be developed so that they can detect image variables and can detect geometry types based on numerical variables. The system is expected to work like humans who can make questions when given a text, numeric, image, or mathematical notation. By combining the Stem, Multi Part Parser Algorithm and the Custom Media Type Parser Algorithm in the Python-Django framework, the system can provide question recommendations according to mathematical geometry-based input. The process of generating items in this study will use the concept of manipulation of keywords represented by variables. This variable stores values in the form of text, numeric, and image. The ability to manipulate text, numerics, and images is applied to the developed AQG system so that it can be used to generate questions on the material to be tested. AQG is expected to be able to detect text, numeric, notation, and image input and produce output in the form of geometry-based mathematical problems according to text, numeric, notation, and image input with a better level of accuracy. © 2020 IOP Publishing Ltd.

Improving Money Laundering Detection Using Optimized Support Vector Machine,"Identification of financial transactions as suspicious or fraudulent transactions that are indicated as money laundering is mostly done manually so that it is not optimal. Data mining techniques can be a solution to overcome the limitations of the manual method. The main challenge in applying data mining techniques for financial fraud detection is an imbalanced dataset, where the proportion of fraud class is much smaller than non-fraud. This causes the model to produce unbalanced precision and recall, resulting in a low f1score. It means that the model can predict one class well, but not with another class. In this paper, the approach to fraud detection in financial transactions is carried out with classifier optimization based on Support Vector Machine (SVM). Optimization is performed by tuning the kernels and hyperparameters combined with the Random Under Sampling (RUS) technique. Specifically, RUS is used to handle imbalanced datasets and cut model training time. With this combination technique, the classifier can detect fraud more effectively with an increase in precision of 40.82% and f1-score of 22.79% compared to the previous study. A combination technique can be an approach to cover weaknesses left behind by a single method. © 2019 IEEE.",Anti Money Laundering; Data Mining; Fraud Detection; RUS; SVM Classifier Crime; Finance; Intelligent systems; Laundering; Support vector machines; Financial fraud detections; Financial transactions; Fraudulent transactions; Imbalanced Data-sets; Imbalanced dataset; Money laundering; Precision and recall; Random under samplings; Data mining
Dropout Prediction Optimization through SMOTE and Ensemble Learning,"Dropout rates on Massive Open Online Courses (MOOCs) are still very high. One effort to reduce the number of dropouts is by interfering at-risk students. An accurate and high consistency prediction system is needed. Machine learning method is the most popular in handling this case. The focus of machine learning that ensures the ability of models in generalizing knowledge makes overfitting a critical issue in supervised learning. Thus, a single classifier may fail to classify correctly. Besides, the inherent class imbalance between dropout (majority class) and non-dropout (minority) makes it difficult to build robust predictions. To overcome this problem, an ensemble learning (EL) is combined with synthetic minority over-sampling technique (SMOTE). The SMOTE-Ensemble Learning (SEL) is done by majority voting from three base machine learning methods: Logistic Regression (LR), K-Nearest Neighbor (KNN) and Random Forest (RF). The result on the KDDCUP2015 dataset shows that this combination able to improve prediction performance with an average improvement of the harmonic mean of precision and recall (F1-score): 7.74% compared to previous work. © 2019 IEEE.",Dropout Prediction; Ensemble Learning; KDDCUP2015; Massive Open Online Courses; SMOTE Decision trees; Intelligent systems; Logistic regression; Machine learning; Nearest neighbor search; K nearest neighbor (KNN); Machine learning methods; Massive open online course; Precision and recall; Prediction performance; Prediction systems; Robust predictions; Synthetic minority over-sampling techniques; Forecasting
Development and evaluation of adaptive metacognitive scaffolding for algorithm-learning system,"Adaptive metacognitive scaffolding is developed to provide learning assistance on an as-needed basis; thus, advances the effectiveness of computer-based learning systems. Metacognitive scaffoldings have been developed for some science subjects; however, not for algorithm-learning. The learning algorithm is different from learning science as it is more oriented to problem-solving; therefore, this study is aimed to describe the modelling, development, and evaluation of the adaptive metacognitive scaffolding which is dedicated for encouraging algorithm-learning. In addition, the authors present a new approach for learner modelling to find students' metacognitive state. Adaptivity of the scaffolding is based on the learner modelling. To evaluate the effectiveness of the developed system, it is deployed in a real algorithm-learning classroom of 38 students. The class is randomly divided into two groups: experiment and control. Two parameters are measured from both groups, i.e. academic success and academic satisfaction. Non-parametric statistical test, i.e. Mann-Whitney U-test (significance level 0.01) rejects the null hypothesis (U-value = 86.5 and U-critical = 101). This result verifies that the academic success of the experiment group is significantly higher than that of the control group. In addition, an academic satisfaction survey shows that adaptive scaffolding is valid in assisting students while learning with the system. © The Institution of Engineering and Technology 2018.", Learning systems; Scaffolds; Statistical tests; Students; Algorithm learning; Computer-based learning systems; Learning science; Mann-Whitney U test; Metacognitive scaffoldings; Non-parametric statistical tests; Null hypothesis; Significance levels; Learning algorithms
Sentiment analysis on product review using support vector machine (SVM),"Public opinion can influence an organization or a company profile. It is important for the company to evaluate public response regarding their products. However, monitoring and organizing of public opinion are not easy. There are many published opinions in social media that is difficult to be processed manually. Therefore, a technique for automatically categorizing public reviews into positive or negative is needed. This research examined the classification of user reviews on products Windows Phone by implementing Support Vector Machine (SVM). This study used four different methods in tokenization stage: unigram, bigram, trigram, and n-gram. In the preprocessing data, there were 8 experiments whereas each group implemented 2 stemming algorithms (Snowball Stemmer and Iterated-Lovin Stemmer). The results were used as input of classification. Each input was classified 3 times with values C 0.25, 0.5, and 1.0. In conclusion, the result yielded the most appropriate model from n-gram with algorithm Iterated-Lovin Stemmer and C value 1.0. Finally, the use of SVM proves to be feasible approach of sentiment analysis regarding specific product. © 2019 IEEE.",Bigram; N-gram; Sentiment analysis; Support vector machine; Trigram; Unigram Sentiment analysis; Social aspects; Appropriate models; Company profile; Product reviews; Public opinions; Public review; Stemming algorithms; Tokenization; Windows phones; Support vector machines
What is informatics education students’impression of using metacognitive training system at the first time?,"The use of Metacognitive Training System (MTS) is relatively new in Indonesia. Previously, a prototype of MTS has been developed and applied in Universitas Gadjah Mada. To become a massive product, the prototype of the MTS must be tested on a larger scale. It is intended to capture user impression about a new product. In this paper, we present User Experience (UX) measurement for the developed MTS in larger scale, involving 90 undergraduate students of informatics education at Universitas Negeri Malang. Two UX measurement methods are used, including User Experience Questionnaires (UEQ) and short-interview. UEQ is used for capturing general impressions, whereas, short-interview is conducted to get deeper feedback about the efficacy of the MTS in their studies. The UX measurement result is benchmarked and revealed that Attractiveness, Efficiency, and Stimulation categorized excellent and the interview result shows that more than 75% respondent responds with the positive answer in five questions. With this result, it could be concluded that the MTS is ready for massive product. © 2018 IEEE.",Metacognitive training system; Student impression; User experience Informatics; Information systems; Information use; Surveys; Indonesia; Informatics education; Measurement methods; Metacognitives; Training Systems; Undergraduate students; User experience; User experiences (ux); Students
User-centered design on metacognitive training system: A case in algorithm and data structure course,"Metacognitive training system (MTS) is a computer-based learning system aimed at developing students' metacognition. Metacognition is needed to develop students' self-regulation which is required for learning complex topics such as algorithm and data structure (ADS). Previously, we develop an MTS to support algorithm-learning. However, the approach tends to be technology-centered, thus, producing low usability score. Therefore, this paper proposes an incorporation of user-centered design (UCD) into the development of the MTS to produce a more usable system. As a result, new information architecture, wireframe, and user interface design are obtained. Finally, the system usability testing is conducted to compare two versions of the MTS, i.e. older and newer version. The result shows that the newer version has higher usability scale. In addition, the newer version of the MTS shows a positive impact on a real learning situation, indicated by the significant difference on students' performance between control and experiment group. © 2018 IEEE.",Algorithm and data structure; Metacognitive training system; User interface design; User-centered design Cognitive systems; Curricula; Data structures; Learning algorithms; Software design; Students; User centered design; Algorithm learning; Computer-based learning systems; Information architectures; Learning situation; Students' performance; Training Systems; User Centered Design(UCD); User interface designs; User interfaces
A Framework for Improving Recommendation in Adaptive Metacognitive Scaffolding,"Metacognitive scaffolding is an important pedagogical support to encourage self-regulated learning, especially in computer-based learning environments. Currently, an e-learning system which is complemented by metacognitive scaffolding has been developed. The scaffolding includes a recommendation system given by a virtual pedagogical agent. However, an academic satisfaction evaluation on the system reveals that the recommendation is less helpful. Therefore, this paper proposes a framework for providing a better recommendation. Two types of recommendations are aimed, including recommendation for the definition of learning goal/sub-goal and learning strategy. Goal/sub-goal recommendation is generated by identifying students' level of prior knowledge by using text classification algorithm. On the other hand, the strategy-use recommendation is generated by modeling the fitness of previously used learning strategy using fuzzy inference system and analyzing students' interaction log with the learning strategy. Implementation of the proposed scheme produces a prototype of the recommendation system. An A/B testing is conducted to compare previous and newer recommendation systems. The test shows that most of the users prefer to use the improved recommendation system. © 2018 IEEE.",algorithm learning; fuzzy inference system; metacognitive scaffolding; recommendation; student modeling Classification (of information); Computer aided instruction; E-learning; Fuzzy inference; Fuzzy systems; Inference engines; Learning systems; Scaffolds; Students; Text processing; Algorithm learning; Fuzzy inference systems; Metacognitive scaffoldings; recommendation; Student Modeling; Recommender systems
Tahani model of fuzzy database for an adaptive metacognitive scaffolding in Hypermedia Learning Environment (Case: Algorithm and structure data course),"Studies show that an adaptive learning environment is needed by learners. Adaptive e-learning systems have been developed with personalized instructions based on student's knowledge level. Since each student has a unique cognitive and metacognitive level, we currently develop an adaptive Hypermedia Learning Environment (HLE) for Algorithm and Data Structure Course based on a metacognitive awareness level. HLE provides adaptive scaffolding as instructional interventions to facilitate students' aptitude in programming. Scaffolding can be determined by knowing student's metacognitive awareness level. In this research, we propose the use of Tahani Model of Fuzzy Database in web-based HLE to support the adaptive decision-making. Tahani is one of some feasible models in a fuzzy database that can categorize students' metacognitive awareness level. The produced fuzzy rules have been validated by metacognitive experts of educational psychology. A hundred students have been categorized into three groups (low, medium, high) and provided with appropriate scaffolding. Evaluation results verified the suitability of the proposed method and the student's scaffolding. © 2017 IEEE.",adaptive; e-learning; fuzzy database; metacognitive; scaffolding; Tahani model Adaptive systems; Database systems; Decision making; E-learning; Fuzzy inference; Hypermedia systems; Learning algorithms; Learning systems; Scaffolds; Students; Sustainable development; adaptive; Adaptive e-learning systems; Adaptive hypermedia learning; Adaptive learning environment; Fuzzy database; Hypermedia learning environments; Metacognitives; scaffolding; Computer aided instruction

Enhancing student clustering to generate adaptive metacognitive instructions in learning system for vocational high school,"Adaptivity in learning systems depends on accuracy of learner modelling. Specifically, for generating cluster-based instructions, quality of student clustering is critical. Studies on student clustering are abundant; however, a system for clustering metacognitive that considers proper analysis technique of Likert-scaled dataset is unavailable. This article proposes a student clustering method which uses a new Likert scale analysis. It is performed on a dataset collected from 81 students of a vocational high school. The performance was compared to previous methods; enhancement is shown by higher silhouette-index and strong correlation with work readiness score. To evaluate the clustering effectiveness, it is implemented on an e-learning system to generate adaptive instructions. The e-learning system is a supplement for fundamental programming course in the school. The t-test result shows that learning gain of experiment group is significantly higher that of the control group. Therefore, the proposed method is effective in improving students' learning quality.

Semi-supervised learning approach for Indonesian Named Entity Recognition (NER) using co-training algorithm,"The problem of utilizing machine learning approach in Indonesian Named Entity Recognition (NER) system is the limited amount of labelled data for training process. However, unlike the limited availability of labelled data, unlabelled data is widely available from many sources. This enables a semi-supervised learning approach to solve this NER system problem. This research aims to design a semi-supervised learning model to solve NER system problem. A semi-supervised co-training learning is used to utilize unlabelled data in NER learning process to produce new labelled data that can be applied to enhance a new NER classi□cation system. This research uses two kinds of data, Indonesian DBPedia data as labelled data and news article text from Indonesian news sites (kompas.com, cnnindonesia.com, tempo.co, merdeka.com and viva.co.id) as unlabelled data. The pre-processing steps applied to analyze unstructured text are sentence segmentation, tokenization, stemming, and PoS Tagging. The results of this pre-process are the NER and its context used as unlabelled data for the semi-supervised co-training process. The SVM algorithm is used as a classi□cation algorithm in this process. 10 Cross Fold Validation is used as the system testing approach.

Risk model development for information security in organization environment based on business perspectives,"Digital information plays an essential role in supporting organizational business. However, incidents of sensitive information leakage often happen in organization environment. Therefore, risk analysis needs to be performed to recognize the impact of information security threat in organization. In order to carry out those risk analyses, risk model is needed to map risk of information security threat. The selection of proper risk model provides proper result related to risk analysis. The proper risk model must have objectivity and appropriate context. However, most of the existing risk models focus on the technical approach and use expert judgment as a weighting method. Meanwhile, organizations use business perspectives to determine decisions. Therefore, this study has the objective to fill the needs of organizations by developing a new risk model. The proposed risk model focuses on business aspects involvement and reducing subjective methods. The proposed risk model also uses three processes to result output, i.e., adaptable classification data, data measurement and cross-label analysis. Test mining and categorical clustering are involved to handle those three processes. Testing of the proposed model is carried out to define ability and limitation of model by involving 30 targets. The result states that the proposed model has advantages in objectivity, context approach and detailed output, while the limited scope of work becomes weakness of these models. © 2020, Springer-Verlag GmbH Germany, part of Springer Nature.",Categorical clustering; Information security; Risk model; Text mining Ability testing; Risk analysis; Security of data; Security systems; Business aspects; Business perspective; Categorical clustering; Data measurements; Digital information; Information security threats; Sensitive informations; Subjective methods; Risk assessment

A review on smartphone usage data for user identification and user profiling,"The amount of retrievable smartphone data is escalating; while some apps on the smartphone are evidently exploiting and leaking users' data. These phenomena potentially violate privacy and personal data protection laws as various studies have showed that technologies such as artificial intelligence could transform smartphone data into personal data by generating user identification and user profiling. User identification identifies specific users among the data based upon the users' characteristics and users profiling generates users' traits (e.g. age and personality) by exploring how data is correlated with personal information. Nevertheless, the comprehensive review papers discussing both of the topics are limited. This paper thus aims to provide a comprehensive review of user identification and user profiling using smartphone data. Compared to the existing review papers, this paper has a broader lens by reviewing the general applications of smartphone data before focusing on smartphone usage data. This paper also discusses some possible data sources that can be used in this research topic. © 2021 Komunitas Ilmuwan dan Profesional Muslim Indonesia.

Mental stress detection via heart rate variability using machine learning,"Mental stress is an undesirable condition for everyone. Increased stress can cause many problems, such as depression, heart attacks, and strokes. Psychophysiological conditions possible use as a reference to a person’s mental state of stress. The development of mobile device technology, along with the accompanying sensors, can be used to measure the psychophysiological condition of its users. Heart rate allows measured from the photoplethysmography signal utilizing a smartphone or smartwatch. The heart rate variability is currently one of the most studied methods for assessing mental stress. Our objective is to analyze stress levels on the subjects when performing tasks on the smartphone. This study involved 41 students as respondents. Their heart rate was recorded using a smartphone while they were doing the n-back tasks. The n-back task is one of the performance tasks used to measure working memory and working memory capacity. In this study, the n-back task was also used as a stressor. The heart rate dataset and n-back task results are then processed and analyzed using machine learning to determine stress levels. Compared with three other algorithms (neural network, discriminant analysis, and naïve Bayes), the k-nearest neighbor algorithm is most appropriate to use in the classification of time and frequency domain analysis. © 2020, School of Electrical Engineering and Informatics.

Reliability analysis of risk model metrics based on business approach in information security,"Threat of information security has impact to business of organization. Therefore, the development of information security risk model should consider business perspective. In order to develop new risk model, defining metrics is important process. It can be conducted by theoretical analysis, validity analysis and reliability analysis. Theoretical analysis and validity analysis had been performed in previous work. Furthermore, reliability analysis is performed in this paper. Cronbach's Alpha is required as method to measure reliability coefficient from five proposed metrics namely reputation, financial impact, critical level, business type of organization, and size of organization. Reliability analysis from proposed metrics results coefficient between 0.70-0.91. Based on previous researches, metric is reliable if it has coefficient greater than 0.65. Therefore, proposed metrics have adequate reliability to be used as metrics of risk model. © 2020 International Information and Engineering Technology Association.

Resource allocation model for grid computing environment,"Grid computing is a collection of heterogeneous resources that is highly dynamic and unpredictable. It is typically used for solving scientific or technical problems that require a large number of computer processing cycles or access to substantial amounts of data. Various resource allocation strategies have been used to make resource use more productive, with subsequent distributed environmental performance increases. The user sends a job by providing a predetermined time limit for running that job. Then, the scheduler gives priority to work according to the request and scheduling policy and places it in the waiting queue. When the resource is released, the scheduler selects the job from the waiting queue with a specific algorithm. Requests will be rejected if the required resources are not available. The user can re-submit a new request by modifying the parameter until available resources can be found. Eventually, there is a decrease in idle resources between work and resource utilization, and the waiting time will increase. An effective scheduling policy is required to improve resource use and reduce waiting times. In this paper, the FCFS-LRH method is proposed, where jobs received will be sorted by arrival time, execution time, and the number of resources needed. After the sorting process, the work will be placed in a logical view, and the job will be sent to the actual resource when it executes. The experimental results show that the proposed model can increase resource utilization by 1.34% and reduce waiting time by 20.47% when compared to existing approaches. This finding could be beneficially implemented in cloud systems resource allocation management. © 2020, Universitas Ahmad Dahlan.

"Integration of indoor localization system using wi-fi fingerprint, bluetooth low energy beacon and pedometer based on android application platform","Location-based service has become an important element in indoor positioning with increasing precision. Indoor technologies help with user navigation and positioning in specific locations. Many location-based services and applications have been developed to improve indoor positioning, especially to deal with the complexity of location awareness systems. This study proposes the use of Wi-Fi Fingerprint (Wi-Fi), pedometer and Bluetooth Low Energy 4.0 (BLE) beacon to measure and pinpoint user's indoor locations using received signal strength-based indoor localization. The system tracks, directs and guides user's indoor movements using an android application and assists first-time visitors to find a particular location. The networks are comparable and can be detected using smartphones. The phones will detect the strongest signal from the available networks. Wi-Fi, pedometer and BLE 4.0 beacon were able to identify the direction and location in indoor environments and assist user to find their specific destination easily. The map provided by the system based on position information has an accuracy of 91.5% at the third floor and 97.1 % at the second floor, and the signals have seamlessly worked together in integrated fashion when user is in indoor environment. The system is also able to highlight pathway according to user's current location and destination, in addition to being fast responding, secure and robust. The application enables seamless service in real-time operation and provides multiple pathways, guidance and highlighted map for indoor localization. The display of distance between the user and the destination as the user near the target destination is an extremely helpful feature in the application. © 2020, Intelligent Network and Systems Society.",Indoor positioning; Location awareness; Location tracking; Navigation system 
Anomaly detection for elderly home care,"In this paper, we propose a model for detecting anomalies in elderly home care. Two scenarios are investigated in detecting anomalies: 1) the elderly person's vital signs and their surrounding environment; 2) the mobility patterns of the elderly. We evaluated our proposed model by employing the isolation forest which detects anomalies using an isolation approach on a random forest of decision trees. We compare isolation forest on unlabeled data with statistical methods on labelled data. Subsequently, to show the reliability of the isolation concept, we compare it with a distance measure concept. The experiment shows that isolation forest has higher detection accuracy and lower error prediction for two attributes in the first scenario: skin temperature and heart rate, whereas, in the second scenario, multi-covariance determinant has a slightly better accuracy compared to isolation forest (3.9% difference in accuracy) and has a small number of prediction errors compared to isolation forest.

"Improving the accuracy of text classification using stemming method, a case of non-formal Indonesian conversation","Background: Stemming has long been used in data pre-processing to retrieve information by tracking affixed words back into their root. In an Indonesian setting, existing stemming methods have been observed, and the existing stemming methods are proven to result in high accuracy level. However, there are not many stemming methods for non-formal Indonesian text processing. This study introduces a new stemming method to solve problems in the non-formal Indonesian text data pre-processing. Furthermore, this study aims to improve the accuracy of text classifier models by strengthening stemming method. Using the Support Vector Machine algorithm, a text classifier model is developed, and its accuracy is checked. The experimental evaluation was done by testing 550 datasets in Indonesian using two different stemming methods. Findings: The results show that using the proposed stemming method, the text classifier model has higher accuracy than the existing methods with a score of 0.85 and 0.73, respectively. These results indicate that the proposed stemming methods produces a classifier model with a small error rate, so it will be more accurate to predict a class of objects. Conclusion: The existing Indonesian stemming methods are still oriented towards Indonesian formal sentences, therefore the method has limitations to be used in Indonesian non-formal sentences. This phenomenon underlies the suggestion of developing a corpus by normalizing Indonesian non-formal into formal to be used as a better stemming method. The impact of using the corpus as a stemming method is that it can improve the accuracy of the classifier model. In the future, the proposed corpus and stemming methods can be used for various purposes including text clustering, summarizing, detecting hate speech, and other text processing applications in Indonesian. © 2021, The Author(s).",Accuracy; Classification; Indonesian; Stemming; Text processing 
Confirmation of Personality Types Using Visual Evoked Potential with User Interface Design Stimulus,"After obtaining the consistency of Visual Evoked Potential (VEP) by using a stimulus with data-entry user interface design. This study tries to confirm whether an individual’s VEP will be classified according to personality type, which results from the proceeds of conventional personality tests usually carried out by the organization that is the place of this research. The results of this study will be an attempt to complement the needs of particular organizations for the elicitation stage to show user personas by using personality types as something to consider in software development in organizations. The recording of 20 participants whose personality types were known from the results of personality tests at the organization was completed. Each individual has a unique VEP. to confirm personality types and it is necessary to prove the similarity of VEP between individuals of the same type. 93.75% of VEP is classified according to personality type. Therefore it is necessary to consider that personality type can be used as user persona for user classification at the stage of user needs. To identify personality types at the personality test stage, it is still necessary to add more participants involved to get more convincing results. © 2021.

Improving stemming techniques for non-formal indonesian sentences using incorbiz,"Computer technology emulates the human behaviour in presence of Artificial Intelligence (AI) and Natural Language Processing (NLP). The methods make computers act like humans to provide automatic answers according to the humans needs. However, the available tools for the Indonesian language in NLP are very limited, so the linguistic processing of Indonesian on computer is difficult. Linguistic computation requires a process, so the sentences can be analyzed using certain methods. The process of data pre-processing consists of case folding, filtering, tokenizing, and stemming. Stemming is one of the potential problems. The development of NLP in Indonesia is provided by stemming techniques named “Sastrawi”. The packages can be running well because of stemming on formal Indonesian sentences. On the other hand, most of the Indonesian people are using non-formal sentences in online business conversations like “sdh saya tf tlg segera proses” (I have already transferred, please proceed immediately). This research aims to improve stemming techniques for non-formal Indonesian sentences that have not been done by previous researchers. The results showed Incorbiz can find root words that have not been found by other stemming techniques.

Machine learning-based IoT-botnet attack detection with sequential architecture,"With the rapid development and popularization of Internet of Things (IoT) devices, an increasing number of cyber-attacks are targeting such devices. It was said that most of the attacks in IoT environments are botnet-based attacks. Many security weaknesses still exist on the IoT devices because most of them have not enough memory and computational resource for robust security mechanisms. Moreover, many existing rule-based detection systems can be circumvented by attackers. In this study, we proposed a machine learning (ML)-based botnet attack detection framework with sequential detection architecture. An efficient feature selection approach is adopted to implement a lightweight detection system with a high performance. The overall detection performance achieves around 99% for the botnet attack detection using three different ML algorithms, including artificial neural network (ANN), J48 decision tree, and Naïve Bayes. The experiment result indicates that the proposed architecture can effectively detect botnet-based attacks, and also can be extended with corresponding sub-engines for new kinds of attacks. © 2020 by the authors.

Physical discomfort and eye movements during arbitrary and optical flow-like motions in stereo 3D contents,"Users of stereo 3D technology commonly report physical discomfort during or after exposure of stereo 3D contents. The discomfort has been associated with sensation of arbitrary and optical flow-like self-motion. However, there is no information on whether arbitrary motion induces stronger physical discomfort compared with optical flow-like motion. To address this research gap, we investigate physical discomfort among players and spectators of stereo 3D contents using eye tracking and Simulator Sickness Questionnaire. Thirty participants (N= 30) acted as players and spectators of a first-person shooter (FPS) and a car racing game. The FPS and the car racing game produce a sensation of arbitrary and optical flow-like self-motion, respectively. Experimental results show that the FPS game induces more severe physical discomfort than its racing counterpart (p< 0.0083 , with a Bonferroni correction to the p value). We also found that severeness of oculomotor symptoms can be predicted using two eye movements metrics: the amount of fixational eye movements and viewing duration at the center of the screen. Our study implies that one should pay particular attention to different types of self-motion in stereo 3D contents regardless of whether the user controls or solely watches the contents. Our study also suggests that physical discomfort can be reduced by decreasing the frequency of fixational eye movements while prolonging the duration of each fixation at the center of screen. © 2019, Springer-Verlag London Ltd., part of Springer Nature.",Cybersickness; Eye tracking; Human factors in virtual reality; Stereo 3D Eye tracking; Optical flows; Racing automobiles; Virtual reality; 3D technology; Bonferroni correction; Cybersickness; First person shooter; Fixational eye movements; Self motion; Simulator sickness; User control; Eye movements
A Proposed user requirements document for children's learning application,"User requirements are the highest level of requirements. Flawed user requirements document can cause defects in the software being built-aspects of applications that were not presented in the user requirements document to cause a defect. In learning applications for children, there are aspects of pedagogy that need to be well documented. This aspect is not available in the general user requirements document, so it is often not well presented. The learning style and thinking skills level is crucial to be well presented in the user requirements document. That was because the children's persona cannot be compared at every range criteria of developmental age. That factor will undoubtedly affect the specifications of the software to be built. Users' viewpoints about different requirements can also make developers wrong in determining requirements. Applying requirements prioritization in the user requirements document can help resolve the problem. Measurement of document quality was also performed using parameters in measuring the quality of the user requirements document. The results of measuring the quality of the user requirements document found that it is reliable for use. © 2020, Science and Information Organization.",Aspect of pedagogy children; Learning application; User requirements; User requirements document Application programs; Computer aided instruction; Aspect of pedagogy child; Children learning; Learning application; Learningstyles; Requirements document; Skill levels; Thinking skills; User requirement document; User requirements; Defects
Identification of children learning styles using elicitation application,"Learning styles is one aspect of pedagogy that needs to be considered in the learning process. Understanding of material will be achieved if it is by the learning styles. Children do not have experience in the learning process, so identification of children learning styles is needed. The cognitive, psycho-motor and emotional abilities of children in each varying age range become a factor that determines learning styles. Learning styles tend to be recommended to children in the form of visual, audio, read/write and kinesthetic. Identification can be made towards learning styles that are by the child's preferences. The use of digital applications will be more accurate when compared to questionnaires in identifying learning styles. The presentation of interactive material and immersive in each learning styles can help identify children's learning styles. The assessment of material understanding was clarified in elicitation apps. The material evaluation was presented in the form of a set of questions related to the material presented. Interactions in the evaluation activities in the apps were presented according to the child's learning styles. Output produced by the application can be used by learning application developers, teachers, or parents in identifying children's learning styles. © 2020 Mira Kania Sabariah, Paulus Insap Santosa and Ridi Ferdiana.",Children; Children's learning styles; Learning process; Learning styles 
Model of tools for requirements elicitation process for children's learning applications,"Requirements Elicitation are the initial stages in the application development process, where a set of needs from the system will be built and obtained by communicating with stakeholders who have a direct and indirect influence on those needs. Failure in the requirements elicitation process was caused by weak communication. Communication is an essential thing in carrying out the requirements elicitation process. The selection of the right elicitation technique is not only a solution. Informants as sources of information on requirements also need to be considered. The choice of the correct technique often fails because of the tools not useful. The availability of the right form of equipment needs to be considered so that the communication between the elicitation team and the informant goes well. Children have characteristics not the same as adults. Limitations in terms of psychomotor, cognitive, and emotional children are considered in choosing elicitation techniques and tools. These limitations are also influenced by the age range of child development. The use of digital elicitation devices is recommended to be used in the requirements elicitation process. The presentation of interactive tools makes it easier for children to convey their desires. In learning applications for children, aspects of pedagogy that need to be explored are learning styles and children's thinking abilities. Every child in every age range has a different preference for learning style. That is because children do not have learning experiences. That also applies to the level of thinking ability of children. Therefore, these two things need to be appropriately explored when the learning application development process. The proposed elicitation tool model was made by taking into account both components of that pedagogical aspects. The test results of the built model show that the application has satisfaction. That means that children can communicate well in conveying the needed as requirements to the learning application. © 2020, Science and Information Organization.",Children learning application; Communication; Learning style; Pedagogical aspect; Requirements elicitation Computer aided instruction; Digital devices; Learning systems; Application development process; Child learning application; Children learning; Elicitation techniques; Learningstyles; Pedagogical aspects; Psychomotors; Requirements elicitation; Sources of informations; Techniques and tools; Requirements engineering
Towards a lightweight detection system for cyber attacks in the IoT environment using corresponding features,"The application of a large number of Internet of Things (IoT) devices makes our life more convenient and industries more efficient. However, it also makes cyber-attacks much easier to occur because so many IoT devices are deployed and most of them do not have enough resources (i.e., computation and storage capacity) to carry out ordinary intrusion detection systems (IDSs). In this study, a lightweight machine learning-based IDS using a new feature selection algorithm is designed and implemented on Raspberry Pi, and its performance is verified using a public dataset collected from an IoT environment. To make the system lightweight, we propose a new algorithm for feature selection, called the correlated-set thresholding on gain-ratio (CST-GR) algorithm, to select really necessary features. Because the feature selection is conducted on three specific kinds of cyber-attacks, the number of selected features can be significantly reduced, which makes the classifiers very small and fast. Thus, our detection system is lightweight enough to be implemented and carried out in a Raspberry Pi system. More importantly, as the really necessary features corresponding to each kind of attack are exploited, good detection performance can be expected. The performance of our proposal is examined in detail with different machine learning algorithms, in order to learn which of them is the best option for our system. The experiment results indicate that the new feature selection algorithm can select only very few features for each kind of attack. Thus, the detection system is lightweight enough to be implemented in the Raspberry Pi environment with almost no sacrifice on detection performance. © 2020 by the authors.

Implementing Lightweight IoT-IDS on Raspberry Pi Using Correlation-Based Feature Selection and Its Performance Evaluation,"The application of many IoT devices is making our world more convenient and efficient. However, it also makes a large number of cyber-attacks possible because most IoT devices have very limited resources and cannot perform ordinary intrusion detection systems. How to implement efficient and lightweight IDS in IoT environments is a critically important and challenging task. Several detection systems have been implemented on Raspberry Pi, but most of them are signature-based and only allow limited rules. In this study, a lightweight IDS based on machine learning is implemented on a Raspberry Pi. To make the system lightweight, a correlation-based feature selection algorithm is applied to significantly reduce the number of features and a lightweight classifier is utilized. The performance of our system is examined in detail and the experimental result indicates that our system is lightweight and has a much higher detection speed with almost no sacrifice of detection accuracy. © 2020, Springer Nature Switzerland AG.", Computer crime; Internet of things; Intrusion detection; Learning systems; Network security; Cyber-attacks; Detection accuracy; Detection speed; Detection system; Feature selection algorithm; Intrusion Detection Systems; On-machines; Feature extraction
Improving Confusion-State Classifier Model Using XGBoost and Tree-Structured Parzen Estimator,"Detecting confusion has been considered as a critical issue in online education platforms. Confusion emerged as an effect of the limited interaction between lecturers and learners. The confusion detection machine learning model can be used to overcome the problem. Such a model can provide the ability for online education systems to detect confusion, thus it can react accordingly. Encouraged by the need, several studies have been done to develop confusion-state classifier models. The best previous model has an average accuracy of 75%. Despite having a promising result, the model still contains several gaps that can be improved. The gaps lie in the selection of the machine learning algorithm and the absence of any hyper-parameter optimization technique. This study aims to overcome them using two approaches: replacing the machine learning algorithm with XGBoost and applying the Tree-structured Parzen Estimator (TPE) as a hyper-parameter optimization technique. The TPE was also combined with the Recursive Feature Elimination (RFE) technique. The proposed model had outperformed the previous ones by achieving an average accuracy of 87%. This study also brought out the most optimal configuration of features and hyper-parameters to build such a model.

Predicting Student Academic Performance using Machine Learning and Time Management Skill Data,"Prediction of student academic performance is an important aspect in the learning process. This study applies several machine learning models in predicting student academic performance using Time Management Skills data obtained from Time Structure Questionnaire (TSQ). Previously, some other data has been used as a feature in making predictions, but TSQ result had never been used before as a feature, even though it may shows the conditions of how students use their time in learning. Five different machine learning models were trained using TSQ data to predict student academic performance. In addition, student English performance is also predicted in the same way as a comparison As a result, the Linear Support Vector Machine model can predict student academic performance with 80% accuracy and English performance with 84% accuracy using TSQ data. © 2019 IEEE.",Academic Performance; Classification; Machine Learning; Prediction; Time Management Skills Forecasting; Information management; Intelligent systems; Learning systems; Support vector machines; Academic performance; Learning process; Linear Support Vector Machines; Machine learning models; Time management; Students
Conceptual Model for Human Anatomy Learning Based Augmented Reality on Marker Puzzle 3D Printing,"Learning medicine not only requires students to master a variety of abilities but also must follow some doctoral standards.

MUCPSO: A Modified Chaotic Particle Swarm Optimization with Uniform Initialization for Optimizing Software Effort Estimation,"Particle Swarm Optimization is a metaheuristic optimization algorithm widely used across a broad range of applications. The algorithm has certain primary advantages such as its ease of implementation, high convergence accuracy, and fast convergence speed. Nevertheless, since its origin in 1995, Particle swarm optimization still suffers from two primary shortcomings, i.e., premature convergence and easy trapping in local optima. Therefore, this study proposes modified chaotic particle swarm optimization with uniform particle initialization to enhance the comprehensive performance of standard particle swarm optimization by introducing three additional schemes. Firstly, the initialized swarm is generated through a uniform approach. Secondly, replacing the linear inertia weight by introducing the nonlinear chaotic inertia weight map. Thirdly, by applying a personal learning strategy to enhance the global and local search to avoid trap in local optima. The proposed algorithm is examined and compared with standard particle swarm optimization, two recent particle swarm optimization variants, and a natureinspired algorithm using three software effort estimation methods as benchmark functions: Use case points, COCOMO, and Agile. Detailed investigations prove that the proposed schemes work well to develop the proposed algorithm in an exploitative manner, which is created by a uniform particle initialization and avoids being trapped on the local optimum solution in an explorative manner and is generated by a personal learning strategy and chaotic‐based inertia weight. © 2022 by the authors.",Chaotic inertia weight; Particle swarm optimization; Personal learning strategy; Software effort estimation; Uniform particle initialization

Cat sounds classification with convolutional neural network,"In this study, we attempt to use a convolutional neural network (CNN) to identify cats’ different sounds. CNN is proven to classify different patterns from the spectro-temporal features of a sound and thus well suited for sound classification. We will perform data transformation using mel-frequency cepstral coefficients (MFCCs) to extract the sound frequency to apply this method. In MFCCs, each frequency bin is quasi-logarithmically spaced so that it resembles the resolution of the human auditory system compared to the spectrogram. We will be using four convolutional layers of CNN architecture with a pooling layer and dense layer as the output layer in our model. From the sound ontology Audio set, we can collect 595 different sound data classified into five categories of cat sounds, which we used to train our model. From our training process, our model can achieve a classification accuracy of 88.473254%. In the future, we look forward to improving our model accuracy by adding more data and even out each label to reduce overfitting. We would also like to implement a data augmentation method on our dataset to improve our model accuracy. © 2021, School of Electrical Engineering and Informatics.

Developer's Perspectives on Unit Test Cases Understandability,"Good unit testing plays the most important role when it comes to driving and evaluating software quality. However, writing effective tests is a very expensive and time-consuming practice. To reduce such load on developers, there are many different techniques for automatically generating test suites for an existing source code. However, how automatically generated test cases compare to manually written cases is an open research question. There are some understandability issues regarding autogenerated test cases. This paper presents an experiment based on A/B testing methodology to gather developer preferences at test cases presentation. This survey involved 44 developers from 17 country. It founds that majority developers prefer the manual written than automatic generated test cases. This result brings some new perspectives to improve the quality of the automatic generated test case. © 2021 IEEE.",automatic generation; readability; test case; understandability Computer software selection and evaluation; Software quality; Software testing; A/b testing; Automatically generated; Evaluating software; Research questions; Source codes; Understandability; Unit testing; Unit tests; Automatic test pattern generation
Gaze-Controlled Digital Signage for Public Health Education during Covid-19 Pandemic,"For more than a decade, digital signages have been used in health facilities and public environment to provide fun and interactive approach of education. Unfortunately, interacting with conventional digital signage during Covid-19 pandemic raises a concern on its hygiene. Thus, touchless interaction is preferable to avoid direct contact on the touch screen. Here we present a novel study on effectiveness of gaze-based interaction in a digital signage for public health education. Instead of touching the screen, the users engage with the content by gazing at a dynamic button that moves in horizontal or vertical direction. Experimental results show that gazing at faster dynamic buttons (angular speed of 60.28°/s) than its slower counterpart (angular speed of 30.14°/s) requires shorter time to complete a three-steps task (T = 84, Z =-1.977, p < 0.05). Our study provides a scientific proof of concept for further development of touchless digital signage that complies with health protocols of the World Health Organization during Covid-19 pandemic. © 2021 IEEE.",digital signage; Eye tracking; gaze interaction; touchless technology Fasteners; Public health; Touch screens; Gaze-based interaction; Health education; Health facilities; Interactive approach; Proof of concept; Public environment; Vertical direction; World Health Organization; E-learning

Digital Transformation in Higher Education: A Barrier Framework,"The purpose of this study is to highlight the barriers which need to be considered when implementing digital transformation in higher education based on literature and real case. First, a systematic literature review on the barriers to digital transformation in higher education was conducted to identify the barriers. Second, to categorize the findings of the literature review, this study implemented a reference barrier model which consists of four categories (contextual barrier, social barrier, technical barrier, and cultural barrier). Finally, an exploratory case study in the specific context of digital transformation in higher education was carried out to validate the contextualized barrier framework. This study provided a contextualization barrier framework that outlines 22 barriers. Through an evaluation, the relevance level of all barriers was assessed and obtained between 2.88 and 4.00 (scale of 1-5), which means that the finding of the literature review in this study was valid and able to capture the real situations. The result of this research can give a framework for further research in the effort to minimize the effect of each barrier. In addition, the proposed framework was an initial step to standardize the description of barriers and could be used as a starting point to the effectiveness of the formulation of strategies and policies that will be applied. © 2021 ACM.",Barrier framework; Digital transformation; Higher education Barrier framework; Barrier model; Contextualization; Digital transformation; Exploratory case studies; High educations; Real case; Systematic literature review; Technical barriers; E-learning
A Survey of Emotion Recognition using Physiological Signal in Wearable Devices,"Emotion recognition may establish a clinical framework for measuring emotional wellbeing and screening for quality of life, cognitive dysfunction, and mental disorder. Emotions are conveyed not just through interpersonal actions but also by several physiological differences. Emotions can be monitored using physiological signals in wearable devices such as smartwatches or wrist bands. However, there are various challenges for detecting emotion in unrestricted daily life using wearable or smartwatch devices. These challenges result in lower performances of such systems compared to semi-restricted and laboratory environment studies. The addition of uniqueness in each individual physiological signal, physical activity level, and activity type to the physiological signals can affect classification accuracy of these systems. To tackle these challenges, we present a brief literature review on the study of physiological signals using wearable devices primarily from the last three years. The phase of emotion recognition using physiological signals is briefly defined. This paper also presents listed forms of physiological signals and various sensors for detecting them. In addition, we discussed the emotional models and emotional stimulation approaches. This study is expected to bring new insight into research challenges, limitations, and possible future emotion detection and recognition using wearable or smartwatch devices. © 2021 IEEE.",Affective Computing; Affective Wearables; Emotion Recognition; Physiological Signals; Review; Smartwatch; Wearable Devices Artificial intelligence; Physiology; Speech recognition; Wearable computers; Classification accuracy; Emotion recognition; Emotional stimulations; Emotional wellbeing; Laboratory environment; Physical activity levels; Physiological differences; Physiological signals; Biomedical signal processing

The Triangulation Assessment Model for Capstone Project in Software Engineering,"In this article, we discuss how to assess the capstone project in the software engineering domain. The main problem to assess the capstone project in software engineering is the subjectivity and non-standardization of the assessment model. Therefore, there are some challenges to make the assessment consistent between one project to the other. This article proposed a triangulation assessment model for two types of capstone projects in software engineering fields based on the Delphi study performed in one academic year in winter and spring 2019. This article evaluates the consistency of the triangulation assessment model in 10 capstone projects. As a result, the Delphi study clustered this article contribution into three themes: (1) typical capstone project in the software engineering field, (2) triangulation of assessment model in capstone, (3) the characteristics of successful capstone project. © 2020 IEEE.",assessment model; capstone project; software engineering Triangulation; Assessment models; Capstone projects; DELPHI study; Software engineering domain; Software engineering

The Comparison of Cloud Migration Effort on Platform as a Service,"Platform as a Service offers users to easily and quickly deploy applications in the cloud environment without thinking about the availability of supporting resources for developing the application. However, migrating on-premise applications to cloud vendors still has risks ranging from the compatibility of application technology with the cloud platform to the efforts needed. One obstacle in the adoption of cloud technology is the lack of visibility in planning migration efforts. So this study aims to measure and compare the feasibility of PaaS cloud vendors based on the calculation of the effort required during the migration process through an empirical approach. Specifically, an experiment was carried out by migrating on-premise application to Amazon Elastic Beanstalk, Azure App Service, and Google App Engine. Empirical results show that Azure App Service and Amazon Elastic Beanstalk have similar complexity of effort, while Google App Engine has the highest complexity of effort. © 2020 IOP Publishing Ltd.

Test case understandability model,"Several automated test case generation techniques have been proposed to date, although the adoption of such techniques in the industry remains low. A key factor that has contributed to this low adoption rate is the difficulty experienced by the developer in terms of reading and understanding automatically generated test cases. For this reason, it is essential to construct a test case understandability model for improving the generated test case. In the present paper, we extracted 20 test case metrics, six developer related metrics and two understandability proxies from a white-box test case classification experiment. Based on these metrics, we employed classification and regression algorithms to build test case understandability model. From the experiment, we can conclude that combined metrics always exhibit better discriminatory performance in classification models as well as a higher correlation in regression models when compared to a model that involved only test case metrics or developer metrics. © 2020 Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers Inc..

Review of Spectrum Handoff Schemes in Cognitive Radio Networks,"Cognitive radio networks (CRN) are a new technology that offers a promising solution to the problem of spectrum scarcity. To ensure optimal spectrum utilization, when the primary user (PU) is detected to be present on the channel or there is a decrease in spectrum quality, the secondary user (SU) must switch or remain on the channel, this condition is known as spectrum mobility. One of the problems related to spectrum mobility is spectrum handoff, where this handoff plays an important role in supporting the availability and performance of spectrum mobility. This paper presents various schematic handoff modeling techniques for secondary users in performing spectrum handoffs. Apart from channel efficiency, minimizing the number of handoffs is also a challenge. In the future, it is necessary to strive for a handoff algorithm that can adapt to these conditions.. © 2021 IEEE.",Cognitive Radio Networks; Mobility Spectrum; Schematic Handoff Spectrum Radio; Radio systems; Cognitive radio network; Condition; Handoff; Handoff scheme; Mobility spectra; Schematic handoff spectrum; Secondary user; Spectra's; Spectrum handoffs; Spectrum mobilities; Cognitive radio
Handover decision for v2v communication in vanet based on moving average slope of rss,"In a vehicular ad hoc network (VANET), the nodes have very high mobility and hence, it is an important challenge to maintain the quality of communication. Due to the mobility, the vehicle nodes should perform handover from one infrastructure to another. Thus, the better quality of signal can be obtained. In vehicle to vehicle (V2V) communication, the nodes may experience more frequent handover than in vehicle to infrastructure (V2I) communication. Frequent handover can aggravate the networks especially in routing process, since the network topology is also changed when a handover occurred. Moreover, the network resources are also used for handover process and hence the communication overhead increases. In this paper, a handover decision method is proposed to reduce the handover rate in V2V communication while maintaining the quality of signal. The proposed method utilizes the moving average slope of received signal strength (MAS-RSS) and signal to noise ratio (SNR) threshold in handover decision process. The MAS-RSS technique is used to observe the trend of RSS fluctuation and hence the handover can be decided adaptively with the change of the network condition. As the result, the handover rate can be reduced without causing the significant decrease of SNR average compared to the ordinary RSS based handover decision method. © 2021 Journal of Communications.",Handover decision; Mobile infrastructure; Moving average slope; Received signal strength; Vehicle to vehicle; Vehicular ad hoc network 
A controllable rsu and vampire moth to support the cluster stability in vanet,"VANET has a dynamic topology that affects cluster formation stability. It influences vehicle’s network quality though supporting this stability requires a fast and small cluster formation process. It is necessary because of the rapidly changing condition of the vehicle’s position. Moreover, small cluster groups make network quality more evenly distributed among its members. They are essential components in the formation of good clusters in VANET. In the previous research, the algorithm used for this process is based on moth flame optimization. This study proposes modifications in this algorithm to speed up the convergence process, facilitated by a model of turning angles in the moth. Furthermore, the flame at the destination moth is created dynamically to approach the real conditions in VANET. The use of coefficients is further introduced to reduce cluster size according to the traffic conditions. The cluster management process uses a fully controlled Road Side Unit on the vehicle’s traffic conditions. In the final result, the convergence time is slightly faster, with better results in the throughput at 101.1%, the number of clusters at 58.1%, and the delay at 5.5%, respectively. © 2021",Algorithm; Cluster; Mfo; Stable & Vanet 
Roadside Unit Power Saving using Vehicle Detection System in Vehicular Ad-hoc Network,"VANETs need electrical resources to operate their equipment, with the most significant power consumption capable of playing complex roles in the infrastructure network located in the RSU. The main resource of power for the VANET is electricity, which is currently expensive, with excess consumption capable of increasing operational and maintenance costs. Therefore, it is necessary to have an efficient method of using electric power consumption for optimal utilization. Therefore, this research aims to solve these problems by proposing a VDS method, which is capable of detecting vehicles entering the coverage of an RSU. The proposed method tends to enable RSU to run in two operating modes, namely active and sleep. The active mode serves the full connection to the vehicles, while the sleep mode is the idle state of RSU. The application of this method has been proven to reduce the electrical power consumption of RSU macrocell and microcell by 22.2%. The VDS is compelling in low traffic flows, however, it is not inferior when implemented in high vehicle traffic. © 2020 IEEE.",macrocell; microcell; power; rsu; vanet Electric power utilization; Electric utilities; Energy efficiency; Intelligent systems; Vehicles; Electric power consumption; Electrical power consumption; Electrical resources; Infrastructure networks; Macrocell and microcell; Maintenance cost; Optimal utilization; Vehicle detection systems; Vehicular ad hoc networks
Fuzzy Adaptive Hysteresis of RSS for Handover Decision in V2V VANET,"A communication technology which enables the information exchanges between vehicles to support intelligent transportation system is the characteristic of vehicular ad hoc network (VANET). The vast applications of VANET including transportation safety, traffic management, and passenger amenities are also followed by some technical challenges. The rapid topology changes and high nodes mobility are the main source of the challenges. One of the prominent challenges is the handover decision, especially in vehicle to vehicle (V2V) communication. In this paper, handover decision method for V2V VANET is proposed using fuzzy system. The proposed method adjusts the value of received signal strength (RSS) hysteresis adaptively using fuzzy system so that the proposed handover decision method is called fuzzy adaptive hysteresis (FAH). To adjust the value of hysteresis, fuzzy system utilizes RSS value, speed difference, and connected time as the input. Based on the simulation results, the proposed method can reduce handover rate as well as maintaining the higher value of signal to noise ratio (SNR) average. © 2020.

ABNC: Adaptive border node clustering using genes fusion based on genetic algorithm to support the stability of cluster in VANET,"The clustering method in the vehicular ad-hoc network provides an opportunity for a cluster head to improve the network connections, but it still remains a problem in the border cluster. The vehicles, in view of their position in the slices of two clusters, receive a weak signal from the cluster head. The intersection area causes a throughput decrease for cluster members. To provide the network connection in the border cluster, we, in turn, proposed an adaptive border node clustering by utilizing the combination of K-Medoids algorithm, modified Genetic Algorithm and modified Tabu Search. We ameliorated the recent model in Enhanced Model of Weighted K-Medoids Clustering Algorithm by adding the fusion process to the best gene pieces into one individual temporary. The effects of this fusion were on the production of a temporary cluster that can make the main cluster environment more stable. This temporary cluster was adapted to the position of the two closest main cluster heads. Our model was found able to increase throughput and to keep the stability of cluster members at any velocities. The increase in throughput represents an improvement parameter in the network quality of service (QoS). We achieved the overall throughput at 93.97% (throughput vs cluster member) compared with the previous methods and the cluster member stable at around 25 vehicles (cluster member vs transmission range) in varied conditions. © 2019 Intelligent Network and Systems Society.",Clustering; Genetic algorithm; K-medoids; Tabu search 
Utility-based horizontal handover decision method for vehicle-to-vehicle communication in VANET,"Vehicular ad hoc network (VANET) is the emerging wireless communication technology in vehicular domain to support the safety and non-safety purposes in transportation. Despite the potential implementation of VANET, some challenges mainly due to the dynamic environment need to be addressed and tackled. In this paper, the horizontal handover especially in vehicle-to-vehicle (V2V) connection is investigated. The dominant handover decision method in wireless network, namely received signal strength (RSS) based method, is actually inappropriate for the implementation in V2V VANET. Therefore, a utility based handover decision method is proposed in this paper. The utility function is formulated based on the value of signal to noise ratio (SNR) and the load of network. Despite the fluctuation of SNR, the proposed method can make the better handover decision i.e. by reducing the ping pong effect and improving the throughput by selecting the network with lower load. In this research, the proposed method is evaluated through simulations. The results of simulations show that the proposed method can improve the performance of V2V handover in terms of throughput and handover rate compared with the RSS based method. © 2020 Intelligent Network and Systems Society.",Handover decision; Utility; Vehicle-to-vehicle communication; Vehicular ad hoc network 
Applying Metamorphic Testing to E-commerce Website Search Engines,"The main challenges of e-commerce is to attract and maintain a healthy relationship with users, because users simply interact with software. Development of E-commerce in Indonesia within the last four years rapidly increased up to 500%. The growth of e-commerce has made testings on e-commerce important. Search engine is one of the most important features in e-commerce. This study conducts testing on e-commerce's search engines using metamorphic testing. This study proposes MR-Sorting and MR-SubsetEquality. The proposed metamorphic relation is a part of a feature provided by e-commerce. The testing is implemented on three major e-commerce websites used in Indonesia, which is Lazada, Tokopedia, and Blibli. Based on the proposed metamorphic relation, conducted testing discovered an inconsistency problem which could affect customer satisfaction in using e-commerce websites. It is assumed the problem occur on source data in which the feature's implementation wasn't applied on the original source data requested when a user conduct searches on search engines and a product's low description convention on e-commerces. Proposed metamorphic relation in this study can be used on other e-commerce websites. It is expected upon future studies to conduct similar studies on more e-commerce websites so the maturity of the proposed metamorphic improves and to conduct deeper studies on discovered inconsistencies in influencing user satisfaction and the declining quality of e-commerce websites. © 2019 IEEE.",e-commerce; inconsistency; Metamorphic testing; search engines; software quality Customer satisfaction; Electronic commerce; Intelligent systems; Websites; E-commerce websites; Important features; Indonesia; Metamorphic relations; Metamorphic testing; Source data; User satisfaction; Search engines
A Comparative Study Cluster-Based Routing Protocols in VANETs for City Environment,"Vehicular Ad-hoc Networks (VANETs) is consid-ered as an extension of Mobile Ad-hoc Networks (MANETs) which the vehicles have high mobility on the street and in-Termittent connectivity.

Performance study and optimization of multi-channel allocation in VANET under physical channel model,"Vehicular networking has a promising potential as a communication medium to relay the information related with the road safety, traffic efficiency and infotainment and thus many researches are conducted in this area. This research presents a study of multi-channel allocation in orthogonal frequency multiple access vehicular ad hoc network (VANET) under physical channel model. The performance of channel allocation using the altered number of channels allocated per vehicle is observed. An optimization method for channel allocation is also presented. The optimization method is based on meta-heuristic approach namely bacterial foraging optimization algorithm (DBFO). The sets of channels allocated to vehicles are represented by the position of bacterium. To improve the performance of channel allocation, the signal to interference and noise ratio (SINR) of vehicles is used as the objective function of DBFO. Hence, DBFO is utilized to find the appropriate channels for vehicles so that the SINR and the throughput of vehicles can be increased. The performances of multi-channel allocation in VANET and the proposed optimization method are observed through the extensive simulations. The results of the simulations show that increasing the number of channels allocated per vehicle can decrease the SINR average since the interference level increases. Meanwhile the vehicle throughput increases since the more channels allocated to vehicles means the more bandwidth utilized. © 2018, Springer Science+Business Media, LLC, part of Springer Nature.",Channel allocation; Discrete bacterial foraging optimization; Orthogonal frequency multiple access; Vehicular ad hoc network Heuristic methods; Motor transportation; Optimization; Signal interference; Signal to noise ratio; Vehicle performance; Bacterial foraging optimization; Bacterial foraging optimization algorithms; Channel allocation; Meta-heuristic approach; Multi-channel allocations; Multiple access; Physical channel modeling; Signal-to-interference and noise ratios; Vehicular ad hoc networks

MRV-M: A cluster stability in highway VANET using minimum relative velocity based on K-medoids,"The cluster stability is the main feature to be achieved in the vehicular ad-hoc network. There are two primary algorithms in clustering to support cluster stability. These algorithms are K-Means and K-Medoids. They have a purpose of aiming cluster and selecting the Cluster Head (CH). The roadside unit (RSU) in the cluster has a responsibility to select the CH. In general, a central vehicle in a cluster will be selected as a CH. It is not always true whenever the CH has a different velocity with its members and it can influence the cluster stability. To handle this problem, we proposed a new method using relative velocity sorting that was inspired by K-Medoids algorithms. This proposed method is called as Minimum Relative Velocity based on K-Medoids (MRV-M). It combines the velocity and the position of each vehicle to select the best CH. The impact of M-RVM is increasing the stability of the CH duration. It also can increase the CH duration than using the previous method with the original algorithm from both of K-Means and K-Medoids. The proposed method was proved by the stable duration of the CH although it moves in different velocity with its members. Furthermore, it also can be proven in the small cluster size in each cluster. This has a consequence of network performance improvement, especially in throughput. © 2019 IEEE.",Cluster; K-means; K-medoids; Stability; VANET Stability; Vehicular ad hoc networks; Velocity; Cluster head; Cluster stability; K-medoids; K-medoids algorithms; Original algorithms; Relative velocity; Roadside units; Small clusters; K-means clustering
A conceptual framework of adaptive mobile POI recommendations,"Many mobile applications that recommend attractive and customized POIs are often not adaptive enough for users who are actively traveling. Although almost all mobile applications and one concept of the mobile recommendation system have been able to adapt to users, in fact, the findings prove that this is only a small effort that mostly focuses on capturing user behavior during tourism activities. Instead, the Adaptive Mobile Recommendation System (AMRS) is proposed by carrying out all possible configurations that can improve adaptability in mobile applications. Furthermore, the AMRS was built as a new concept based on the Adaptive Tourist Recommendation System (ATRS) concept that was proposed in the past. AMRS takes advantage of the travel cycle and the concept of experiential learning as an unlimited effort of adaptivity that can be applied in a real way using the structure of the recommendation system. © 2019 IEEE",Adaptive; Experiential Learning; Mobile; Recommendation System Behavioral research; Learning systems; Mobile computing; Adaptive; Conceptual frameworks; Experiential learning; Mobile; Mobile applications; Mobile recommendations; Tourism activities; User behaviors; Recommender systems

It is indicated that by utilizing the features of internet telephone service via the Voice over Internet Protocol (VoIP), users are able to make conversation easily and inexpensively. However, with the development, the internet telephone service used is unnecessarily safe for use. One of the solutions proposed is to make end-to-end encryption. This research applied TEA algorithm for encryption into the VoIP client of Sipdroid in Android smartphones. The objective of the research is to find out the effect of the application of TEA algorithm for encryption into the VoIP client of Sipdoid by investigating the performance of TEA algorithm in view of mean opinion score (MOS), delay, and throughput in VoIP. The results of measurement and calculation show that the application of TEA algorithm produced quality speech with R factors of 72.11676-75.01362 smaller than no TEA algorithm application with those of 84.79064-85.38539. Meanwhile, the effect of VoIP performance on such application generated a much larger delay of 0.018084 to 0.024327 seconds compared to no TEA algorithm application with a delay of 0.006071458 to 0.009465105 seconds.

Channel sharing utility function of power control game in cognitive femtocell network,"The use of sharing channel simultaneously has become the trend in telecommunication technology particularly in network with distributed users as the allocation of frequency spectrum becomes more crowded. The proposed power control method in cognitive femtocell network is based on game theory (commonly known as power control game, PCG). This method uses utility function formula as the goal of game theory for power strategy in power update process. Utility function formula of Proposed PCG includes channel sharing factor that aimed to accommodate the system requirement of channel sharing. The result showed that the implementation of channel factor is inversely proportional to the signal to noise and interference ratio (SINR) and transmit power, but proportional to utility function. In comparison of user transmit power and SINR with two other methods, can also be conclude that Proposed PCG was able to achieve SINR of 5.49 dB and above the SINR target 5 dB, while the Thalabani (TB) and Koskie-Gajic (KG) were only able to achieve respective SINR of 4.87 dB and 4.98 dB. It can be concluded that the Proposed PCG was better in achieving the SINR target. It means that the quality of service in this system can be fulfilled properly. © 2019 Institute of Advanced Engineering and Science.",Channel sharing factor; Cognitive femtocell; Game theory; Power control game; Utility function 
Modification of PRoPHET to enhance train-based delay-tolerant networks performance,"Probabilistic Routing Protocols using History of Encounters and Transitivity (PRoPHET) assume that nodes do not move randomly but encounter destinations that have been encountered before. In some original PRoPHET and original PRoPHETv2 testing, they are superior to other routing protocols. Testing in environments that use trains as relay nodes, original PRoPHET performance is worse than the epidemic. This happens because messages delivery to other relay nodes are assumed to encounter the destination (having a larger probability of encountering destination) while the other relay nodes are moving away. The original PRoPHET and the original PRoPHETv2 performance can be improved by delivering a message to relay nodes that will encounter the destination. This can be done by delivering a message to relay nodes with lower probability values encountering the destination. The result obtained is a modified PRoPHET and a modified PRoPHETv2 performance improvement compared to the original PRoPHET and the original PRoPHETv2. © 2019 Intelligent Network and Systems Society.",Lower probability values encountering the destination; Probabilistic routing protocol using history of encounters and transitivity (PRoPHET); PRoPHETv2; Trains 
A novel radio resource optimization scheme in closed access femtocell networks based on bat algorithm,"Femtocell has been considered as a key promising technology to improve the capacity of a cellular system. However, the femtocells deployed inside a macrocell coverage are potentially suffered from excessive interference. This paper proposes a novel radio resource optimization in closed access femtocell networks based on bat algorithm. Bat algorithm is inspired by the behavior of bats in their echolocation process. While the original bat algorithm is designed to solve the complex optimization problem in continuous search space, the proposed modified bat algorithm extends the search optimization in a discrete search space which is suitable for radio resource allocation problem. The simulation results verify the convergence of the proposed optimization scheme to the global optimal solution and reveal that the proposed scheme based on modified bat algorithm facilitates the improvement of the femtocell network capacity.

Pattern of accesibility level of health facilities in yogyakarta,"Regional development programs in the regional autonomy policy require the smallest area unit information. One of those programs is the construction of health facilities. The process of health development in the future requires the pattern of distribution of health facilities that already exists today. Distribution of health facilities in the province of Yogyakarta is still concentrated in urban areas, and the number of health facilities is not comparable with the area of each district. Therefore spatial data analysis using Exploratory Spatial Data Analysis (ESDA) is needed in order to see the pattern of accessibility level of existing health facilities. Spatial analysis considers the spatial correlation among the regions as the object of research. The existence of health facilities in a village will influence the accessibility to health facilities in another village.

Innovative and sustainable research-based learning & community services during lockdown by COVID-19,"The COVID-19 pandemic has caused severe human suffering and substantial damage to life throughout the world. The lockdown caused by COVID-19 also significantly impacted three main elements in UGM education processes, including teaching, research, and community service, where most of their activities involving a large group of people, field, and outdoor programs. Innovation in learning, research, and community service without mobility from home is needed to overcome the impact of Covid-19. Methods of internet-based learning, research, and community service must be established during the pandemic to generate a reliable yet efficient blended program that can accommodate their outcomes. This paper will generally look at the initiative and strategy taken by UGM in planning and developing a sustainable research-based learning and community services. It is based on integrated research-based learning and community service, which integrates former individual education, research, and community service programs. The policy of considering COVID-19 as an emergency at UGM has eliminated teaching and learning activities on campus and replaced them with online learning activities from home. The application of the Three-Centra Education concept, which consists of families, schools, and communities, is truly relevant for developing research-based learning and service programs. Besides, academic and non-academic atmospheres to support integrated education, research, and community service processes in universities in the current era must be developed under millennial students’ style. The millennial approach's adjustment is possible by developing tutoring systems through student-centered learning with the edutainment process that triggers the learning system to be more enjoyable, but the quality is still maintained. This quality of online learning during an emergency in UGM has been improved based on conducted surveys indicating that the advantages of online lectures, according to students, are its flexibility and relaxation; no preparation needed to visit campus; more courageous to ask questions during lecture; most materials are well documented for rereading; time and cost-efficient. Meanwhile, online learning disadvantages covered the fact that the lectures confused with online assignments that caused an excessive workload; the lecturers need to be more interactive and communicative; the schedule should not be frequently changed until later evening, and decrease concentration ability among students. University leaders, the academic community, including alumni, have been building solidarity, compassion, and empathy through food assistance, credit, academic fee reduction, non-bureaucratic procedures for students affected by COVID-19. Co-learning system and work from home in the cyber campus 4.0 for the millennial student in the era of lockdown and destructive innovation with the support of sophisticated information technology and significant data access seems to be the most appropriate learning media. The empowerment online learning system must implement the principles of win–win solution, co-creation, co-finance, flexibility, and sustainability of the proposed programs to strengthen education's real meaning during this pandemic. © The Author(s), under exclusive license to Springer Nature Switzerland AG 2021.",

A Review of Automated Testing Approach for Software Regression Testing,"One of the important parts of software development life-cycle is software testing and one of which is regression testing. Regression testing is done to verify that previously detected errors have been corrected correctly and no new errors arise as a result of incorrect corrections so that the quality of the software being tested is maintained. It is important and must be done. However, the conventional method is not efficient as it is time-consuming, not reusable, and prone to error. In this paper, a comprehensive review of the automated testing approach is presented to be used by other researchers in this field of study. The review result shows that the automated testing approach is suitable to enhance the regression testing with some plausible options of tools e.g. Selenium, SAHI, and Robot-framework. Furthermore, some plausible options of execution methods are also discussed in this paper. This review further concludes that the parallel execution method is considered as a promising choice to conduct the most efficient regression testing process. © Published under licence by IOP Publishing Ltd.", 
Comparison Clustering Performance Based on Moodle Log Mining,"The use of digital data now saves a lot of information, but still raw and not in the form of knowledge that can be directly seen, therefore we need a data processing to get useful particular understanding from raw data. Data Mining has an important role to process and find useful information from data. This process is also called Knowledge Discovery. Educational Data Mining is a Knowledge Discovery process in the world of education using data mining techniques. One method used in data mining is clustering. By using clustering analysis techniques, data can be grouped into groups without the need for prior knowledge (previous knowledge), so that the data is grouped based on similarity of patterns. This paper compares the K-means, Hierarchical and Louvain clustering methods to see the most appropriate clustering technique in analyzing log activity data in Moodle Learning Management System (LMS). The results of clustering are measured using the Silhouette Coefficient, and then we compare the values and distribution between clusters. In conclusion, Hierarchical clustering produces the highest Silhouette Coefficient value and also this algorithm can detect outlier data as new cluster. Louvain clustering perform very well to find cluster groups in new dataset as the algorithm does not required the number of clusters to be specified before. Louvain clustering can divide more evenly and precision compare to K-means and hierarchical cluster techniques. © 2020 Published under licence by IOP Publishing Ltd.",

Parallelized Execution of Serenity Framework Based Automated Test: A Case Study,"Software testing is one of the most important parts of the software development cycle. One of the important software testings to conduct is regression testing. Regression testing is done to verify that no new errors arise as a result of incorrect corrections so that the quality of the software being tested is maintained. The regression testing process is an important process to be carried out on a software product. The use of the automated test is considered as an effective approach for regression testing because the manual regression testing process for each release of software changes will be vulnerable to tester mistake. Serenity framework is one of a framework for conducting automated testing, that is structured, has an automated test report generation feature, and is easy to use. However, in the previous research, the execution of automated tests is done serially which is inefficient in terms of time. To overcome this problem, a parallelization approach is presented in this research. With this parallelization, the regression test has been successfully carried out in a more efficient way and in a more effective way compared to the manual regression tests and the serial test execution. © 2019 IEEE.",automated test; e-learning; parallel computing; regression testing; software quality assurance; software testing Automation; Computer software selection and evaluation; E-learning; Parallel processing systems; Quality assurance; Regression analysis; Software design; Testing; Automated test; Automated testing; Effective approaches; Regression testing; Software development cycles; Software products; Software quality assurance; Software testings; Software testing
Identifying Smartphone Based Features for Automatic Learning Style Identification Approaches Using Correlation Tests,"Learning style identification is attracting considerable interest due to its potential to solve problems in human learning activities and has been widely utilized in learning management systems. Despite this interest, no one has studied learning style identification in an informal learning environment. Moreover, informal learning even plays the biggest role in human lifelong education. This study thus proposes smartphones as a new plausible observation environment, for their uses match the characteristics of informal learning. However, it is not yet known which smartphone parameters are reliable to be used as features in learning style identification models. Therefore, this study aims to find reliable features from smartphones by conducting the Spearman's rank correlation tests between several potential smartphone parameters and the Visual, Aural, Read/Write, Kinesthetic (VARK) learning style scores. The parameters were collected using a dedicated application and tested in two scenarios. We treated the applications individually without clustering in the first scenario, while we clustered the applications by their functions in the second one. The result revealed that there were eight potential features in total. This study has opened more possibilities to improve the development of the learning style identification system. © 2019 IEEE.",Correlation test; Informal learning; Learning style; Smartphone; VARK Computer aided instruction; Smartphones; Automatic-learning; Correlation tests; Informal learning; Informal learning environments; Learning management system; Life-long educations; Potential features; Spearman's rank correlation; Learning systems

Logistic Regression based Feature Selection and Two-Stage Detection for EEG based Motor Imagery Classification,"Electroencephalogram (EEG) based motor imagery (MI) classification requires efficient feature extraction and consistent accuracy for reliable brain-computer interface (BCI) systems. Achieving consistent accuracy in EEGMI classification is still big challenge according to the nature of EEG signal which is subject dependent. To address this problem, we propose a feature selection scheme based on Logistic Regression (LRFS) and two-stage detection (TSD) in channel instantiation approach. In TSD scheme, Linear Discriminant Analysis was utilized in first-stage detection; while Gradient Boosted Tree and k-Nearest Neighbor in second-stage detection. To evaluate the proposed method, two publicly available datasets, BCI competition III-Dataset IVa and BCI competition IV-Dataset 2a, were used. Experimental results show that the proposed method yielded excellent accuracy for both datasets with 95.21% and 94.83%, respectively. These results indicated that the proposed method has consistent accuracy and is promising for reliable BCI systems. © 2021. International Journal of Intelligent Engineering and Systems.

Classification of Learning Styles in Multimedia Learning Using Eye-Tracking and Machine Learning,"The existence of a multimedia learning system still presents the same material for every student. Educational theory suggests that learning content ideally should be adaptive by considering each student's learning style. To make learning more optimal, it is necessary to detect learning styles. Several learning detection approaches have been implemented. Conventional methods such as student assessment tests and interviews tend to be more subjective. An objective method of eye-tracking has been researched but limited as a validation tool for differentiating learning styles. To overcome the above mentioned problems, this study proposes a new approach using machine learning and eye-tracking techniques. The experiment and analysis involved 68 students. There were 23 male participants and 45 female participants. In the experiment, participants were assigned to interact with learning content and their eye movements were recorded using an eye-tracker sensor. From the experimental results using three classification algorithms-SVM, Naïve Bayes, and Logistic Regression-and using SVM-RFE as a feature selection method, the best model was achieved by Naïve Bayes algorithm through three features selected from SVM-RFE method. The model yielded 71% of accuracy, 60% of sensitivity, and 75% of specificity. This empirical study provides an opportunity for machine learning and eye-tracking approaches to automatically classify learning styles. These results can be used as guidelines for developing an adaptive multimedia learning system by considering students' learning styles. © 2020 IEEE.",classification; eye-tracking; learning styles; machine learning; multimedia learning E-learning; Eye movements; Eye tracking; Logistic regression; Students; Support vector machines; Adaptive multimedia; Classification algorithm; Conventional methods; Detection approach; Educational theory; Experiment and analysis; Feature selection methods; Multi-media learning; Learning systems
A Survey of Learning Style Detection Method using Eye-Tracking and Machine Learning in Multimedia Learning,"Current utilization of multimedia learning environment focuses on student-centered approach. This approach is based on a theory stating that learning styles affect individuals in information processing. Based on prior works, there are three main approaches to distinguish learning styles: conventional approach - such as interview and self-reporting, artificial-intelligence-based approach, and sensor-based approach. Unfortunately, there is no comparative analysis that addresses strengths and limitations of these approaches. Thus, there is no information on how and when to use these approaches appropriately. To address this limitation, we present a brief literature review of several studies in distinguishing learning styles, including their strengths and limitations. We also present insights on potential methods of detecting learning styles in multimedia learning based on eye movement data and machine learning algorithms. Our paper is useful as a guideline for developing intelligent e-learning systems based on eye tracking and machine learning. © 2020 IEEE.",cognitive style; eye-tracking; learning style; machine learning; multimedia learning Computer aided instruction; E-learning; Eye movements; Eye tracking; Machine learning; Comparative analysis; Conventional approach; Detection methods; Eye movement datum; Intelligent e-learning systems; Literature reviews; Multi-media learning; Student-centered approach; Learning algorithms
The use of decision table for reducing complex rules in software testing,"The testing phase is always one of the important stages of developing software. Without this stage, software errors will be difficult to find at the beginning of software development. This study uses a decision table method that aims to shorten the rule of software testing. The advantage of this method is that it can help make fewer rule combinations for testing. This study uses a medical information system as a case study. In the medical information system, 20 test cases were identified early in the software testing process. Of the 20 test cases, seven test cases that have the same characteristics so that they can be combined into only 13 test cases. Therefore, it can be concluded that the decision table method can reduce software testing time. © Published under licence by IOP Publishing Ltd.", 
Comparing method equivalence class partitioning and boundary value analysis with study case add medicine module,"Software Testing is helpful to alleviate the developers' task in improving the system. But in doing software testing, there are problems faced by developers, including information that become a benchmark in the feasibility of software testing. Many factors are used to obtain information or benchmarks. These factors can include line code, program structure, business processes and the time used in conducting trials. A test case is needed to ensure one of the two testing processes. The first is to make sure the data type of the entered data. The method of this process is called Equivalence Class Partitioning (ECP). The second is ensuring the lower bound value, the middle bound value, and the upper limit value of the number of strings as inputs of a system module. The method of this process is called Boundary Value Analysis (BVA). The purpose of this study is to compare the ECP and BVA methods. The expected result of this study is to find out the best method between ECP or BVA. Comparison of calculations using standard matrix testing. This study uses 5 parameters as benchmarks.

Improving multi-class EEG-motor imagery classification using two-stage detection on one-versus-one approach,"The multi-class motor imagery based on Electroencephalogram (EEG) signals in Brain-Computer Interface (BCI) systems still face challenges, such as inconsistent accuracy and low classification performance due to inter-subject dependent. Therefore, this study aims to improve multiclass EEG-motor imagery using two-stage detection and voting scheme on one-versus-one approach. The EEG signal used to carry out this research was extracted through a statistical measure of narrow window sliding. Furthermore, inter and cross-subject schemes were investigated on BCI competition IV-Dataset 2a to evaluate the effectiveness of the proposed method. The experimental results showed that the proposed method produced enhanced inter and cross-subject kappa coefficient values of 0.78 and 0.68, respectively, with a low standard deviation of 0.1 for both schemes. These results further indicated that the proposed method has an ability to address inter-subject dependent for promising and reliable BCI systems. © 2020 KIPMI",Motor imagery; Multi-class classification; One-versus-one; Two-stage detection 
Distance matrix based keypoint selection for bag-of-visual words model on image classification,"Bag-of-visual words (BoVW) becomes the most popular approach for local features extraction in image classification. A large number of keypoints lead to high computational costs of visual words generation. Iterative keypoint selection (IKS) as the baseline method has been proposed to reduce the number of keypoints by selecting the representative keypoints. However, random initial keypoint of IKS leads to non-repeatable results. Thus, this paper proposes a distance matrix based keypoint selection (DMKS) algorithm to reduce the number of keypoints. The novelty of this algorithm is the number of representative keypoints can be adjusted to obtain a high classification accuracy and the algorithm does not need random initial keypoints. The performance of proposed algorithm is then compared with that of IKS1 and IKS2. Support vector machine (SVM), K-Nearest Neighbor (KNN), and deep learning (DL H2O) classifiers are used to evaluate the algorithms on the public datasets. On Coil-100 and Caltech-101 datasets, DMKS achieves classification accuracy of 90.22% and 41.99%, respectively. Although the accuracy of DMKS is slightly increase, the processing time of DMKS is faster than the baseline methods. DMKS also produces a smaller number of representative keypoints, therefore DMKS can reduce the time-consuming of visual words generation more effectively in BoVW model. © 2020, Intelligent Network and Systems Society.",Bag-of-visual words; Distance matrix; Image classification; Keypoint selection 
Enhanced Graph Transforming V2 Algorithm for Non-Simple Graph in Big Data Pre-Processing,"Incapability of relational database in handling large-scale data triggers the development of NoSQL database that becomes part of a big data ecosystem. NoSQL database has different characteristics compared to the relational database. However, NoSQL database requires data from the relational database as one of the structured data sources. Therefore, data pre-processing is required to ensure proper data migration from a relational database to NoSQL database. This data pre-processing is normally called data transformation. One of the simple and understandable transformation algorithms is graph transforming algorithm. However, the algorithm has a problem in solving a non-simple graph (multigraph). This research proposes an algorithm to overcome several multigraph problems. The experimental work confirms that the algorithm proposed in this research is able to transform data from a relational database to NoSQL schema that has a minimum number of redundant attributes while the data completeness is still maintained. © 1989-2012 IEEE.",graph; loop; multigraph; multiple edges; SQL to NoSQL Big data; Directed graphs; Ecosystems; Mathematical transformations; Metadata; Redundancy; graph; loop; Multigraphs; multiple edges; Nosql database; Relational Database; SQL to NoSQL; Data handling
Unsupervised software defect prediction using median absolute deviation threshold based spectral classifier on signed Laplacian matrix,"Area of interest: The trend of current software inevitably leads to the big data era. There are much of large software developed from hundreds to thousands of modules. In software development projects, finding the defect proneness manually on each module in large software dataset is probably inefficient in resources. In this task, the use of a software defect prediction model becomes a popular solution with much more cost-effective rather than manual reviews. This study presents a specific machine learning algorithm, which is the spectral classifier, to develop a software defect prediction model using unsupervised learning approach. Background and objective: The spectral classifier has been successfully used in software defect prediction because of its reliability to consider the similarities between software entities. However, there are conditional issues when it uses the zero value as partitioning threshold. The classifier will produce the predominantly cluster when the eigenvector values are mostly positives. Besides, it will also generate low clusters compactness when the eigenvector contains outliers. The objective of this study is mainly to propose an alternative partitioning threshold in dealing with the zero threshold issues. Generally, the proposed method is expected to improve the spectral classifier based software defect prediction performances. Methods: This study proposes the median absolute deviation threshold based spectral classifier to carry out the zero value threshold issues. The proposed method considers the eigenvector values dispersion measure as the new partitioning threshold, rather than using a central tendency measure (e.g., zero, mean, median). The baseline method of this study is the zero value threshold based spectral classifier. Both methods are performed on the signed Laplacian matrix to meet the non-negative Laplacian graph assumption. For classification, the heuristic row sum method is used to assign the entity class as the prediction label. Results and conclusion: In terms of clustering, the proposed method can produce better cluster memberships that affect the cluster compactness and the classifier performances improvement. The cluster compactness average of both the proposed and baseline methods are 1.4 DBI and 1.8 DBI, respectively. In classification performance, the proposed method performs better accuracy with lower error rates than the baseline method. The proposed method also has high precision but low in the recall, which means that the proposed method can detect the software defect more precisely, although in the small number in detection. The proposed method has the accuracy, precision, recall, and error rates with average values of 0.79, 0.84, 0.72, and 0.21, respectively. While the baseline method has the accuracy, precision, recall, and error rates with average values of 0.74, 0.74, 0.89, and 0.26, respectively. Based on those results, the proposed method able to provide a viable solution to address the zero threshold issues in the spectral classifier. Hence, this study concludes that the use of the median absolute deviation threshold can improve the spectral based unsupervised software defect prediction method. © 2019, The Author(s).",Median absolute deviation thresholding; Signed Laplacian matrix; Spectral classifier; Unsupervised software defect prediction; Zero thresholding 
Unsupervised software defect prediction using signed Laplacian-based spectral classifier,"The lack of training dataset availability is the most popular issue in the software defect prediction, especially when dealing with new project development. Adopting training dataset from other software projects probably will not be the best solution because of the software metrics heterogeneity issues across projects. Unsupervised approaches have been proposed to address this issue, where the software prediction model is built without training dataset. Spectral classifier is one of these unsupervised approaches that has been applied successfully to address the lack of training dataset. However, this method leaves an issue when the dataset does not meet the requirement of nonnegative Laplacian assumption. This case would be occurred if there were nonnegative values of the adjacency matrix. It is well known that spectral classifier works with the Laplacian matrix, where the Laplacian matrix is constructed by adjacency matrix. In this paper, the signed Laplacian-based spectral classifier is proposed to solve the negative values problem in the adjacency matrix by converting the negative values into absolute values. The experimental results show that the proposed method could improve the performance of unsupervised classifiers compared to the unsigned Laplacian-based spectral classifier method. Hence, the proposed method is strongly suggested as unsupervised software defects prediction for the software projects that have no historical software dataset. © 2019, Springer-Verlag GmbH Germany, part of Springer Nature.",Absolute adjacency matrix; Signed Laplacian; Spectral clustering; Unsigned Laplacian; Unsupervised software defect prediction Clustering algorithms; Defects; Forecasting; Laplace transforms; Matrix algebra; Adjacency matrices; Laplacian matrices; Laplacians; Software defect prediction; Software prediction models; Spectral classifier; Spectral clustering; Unsupervised approaches; Classification (of information)
Enhancement strict avalanche criterion value in robust S-boxes construction using selected irreducible polynomial and affine matrixes,"One indicator that a robust S-box is an ideal strict avalanche criterion value of 0.5. One method for applying the ideal strict avalanche criterion value is the selection of the precise irreducible polynomial and affine matrix. In this paper, we will discuss the robust S-boxes construction with the selected irreducible polynomial r(x) = x 8 + x 5 + x 3 + x 2 + 1 combined with the three selected affine matrixes i.e. t 1, t 2, and t 3. Hence, the combination of selected irreducible polynomial and affine matrixes results in S-box1, S-box2, and S-box3. The test of strict avalanche criterion shows that S-box2 and S-box3 produce the same value of 0.49951. Nonlinearity and bit independence criterion tests are also conducted to complete the S-box testing.This result shows S-box2 and S-box3 are the best S-boxes compared to S-box1 and S- boxes from previous studies. © 2019 IOP Publishing Ltd.

Classification of Radicalism Content from Twitter Written in Indonesian Language using Long Short Term Memory,"Twitter was one of the most influential social media among users. It might give an either positive or negative impact. One of the negative impacts was the presence of radicalism content. In Indonesia radicalism was often connected to the issue of SARA (ethnicity, religion, race, and intergroup relations). It remained a public issue, requiring an analysis to process information related to radicalism. The research aimed to classify radical contents. The classification based on the types of radicalism and non-radicalism. Data were classified using LSTM. In finding higher accuracy, word2vec was used to transform words into vectors. The accuracy showed using LSTM method was compared with that obtained using SVM and k-NN. The two latest methods were the methods used by previous researchers regarding Indonesian radical contents of Twitter.

Handling Imbalance Issue in Hate Speech Classification using Sampling-based Methods,"In a text classification problem, imbalance nature in dataset oftentimes has been disregarded even though it might significantly have an impact on the results of the classification model performance. This issue also occurred in the hate speech detection where most collected datasets are highly unbalanced. Among state-of-the-art methods that deal with classifying disparity data, the sampling-based technique is the most effective approach in classifying an imbalanced data. In this paper, four resampling methods include Random Oversampling (ROS), Synthetic Minority Technique (SMOTE), Adaptive Synthetic (ADASYN) and Random Undersampling (RUS) are used as an answer to the inequality of class distribution in a hate speech dataset. With three basic machine learning classifiers i.e. Support Vector Machine, Logistic Regression and Naïve Bayes, the evaluation results show that the oversampling approach improves the accuracy and the overall performance of three classifiers. Among all resampling techniques and machine learning algorithms, Logistic Regression enforced by ROS performed the best with an overall accuracy of 91 percent and F1-Score of 0.95. © 2019 IEEE.",hate speech; imbalanced data; oversampling; resampling; text classification; undersampling Embedded systems; Learning algorithms; Learning systems; Logistic regression; Support vector machines; Support vector regression; Text processing; Imbalanced data; Over sampling; Resampling; Text classification; Under-sampling; Classification (of information)
Class Activation Mapping-Based Car Saliency Region and Detection for In-Vehicle Surveillance,"This paper describes a class of problem where a detection and localization of car are addressed simultaneously using in-vehicle camera.

Interference Mitigation in Cognitive Radio Network Based on Grey Wolf Optimizer Algorithm,"Cognitive Radio Network (CNR) is a dynamic network where the users can adjust spectrum usage dynamically in accordance to the operational environment to minimize interference. However, it still has a major problem regarding the channel allocation used by the nodes. This problem exists because channel allocations are completely randomly generated so that they might cause interference to users on the same channel. To handle resource allocation problems in the CRN, the authors proposed a solution using the Grey Wolf Optimizer (GWO). This optimizer algorithm is an optimization included in the metaheuristic algorithm with the source of inspiration from the behavior of the gray wolf colony in hunting prey. In this job, Alpha serves as a prime candidate in finding the best channel. The ultimate goal of using this GWO optimization is to get the most optimal channel allocation scheme for each node in the cognitive radio network so that it has minimal interference and maximum network throughput. The authors have modified the fitness function and coding scheme of GWO to get the best share of resources from the CRN. From the simulations tested, the results showed that channel allocation using the GWO algorithm was able to increase throughput and reduce network interference. © 2020 IEEE.",Channel Allocation; Cognitive Radio Network; Grey Wolf Optimizer; Throughput Intelligent systems; Optimization; Radio; Radio interference; Radio systems; Channel allocation; Cognitive radio network; Fitness functions; Interference mitigation; Meta heuristic algorithm; Network interferences; Operational environments; Resource allocation problem; Cognitive radio
Domain-Specific Contextualized Embedding: A Systematic Literature Review,"Word embedding has successfully resolved various Natural Language Processing (NLP) problems. Unfortunately, the method has a weakness in detecting polysemy and homonym. Those issues led to the emergence of a new approach, which is named contextualized embedding. Many researchers examined such embedding to resolve problems in various particular areas. However, the studies are published disparate and complex. To provide a more comprehensive overview of contextualized embedding research in specific domains, a Systematic Literature Review (SLR) was conducted. The SLR results show that research on domain-specific contextualized embedding pays more attention to solving NLP problems in the Healthcare domain, by the percentage of more than 65%, followed by the Academic Research field and other areas. The popularity of the Healthcare domain is associated with the availability of abundant datasets, mostly in English. BERT is the most contextualized embedding models used for domain-specific tasks, followed by ELMo, and finally GPT-1, as well as XLNET. Almost all reviewed papers reported performance improvements by using domain-specific contextualized embedding in their proposed model. Contextualized embedding can resolve polysemy problems and reduces overfitting. Besides, many downstream tasks have proved the ease implementation of the embedding. The shortcomings of this embedding are the high requirements of computation resources, the long execution time, and the computation complexity. Domain-specific contextualized embedding has resolved many problems, mostly classification tasks (e.g., Question and Answering) and tagging tasks (e.g., Named Entity Recognition). The two evaluation methods for measuring the performance of domain-specific contextualized embedding are Intrinsic evaluation and Extrinsic evaluation. © 2020 IEEE.",contextualized embedding; domain-specific; natural language processing; pre-trained; text representation; word embedding Health care; Natural language processing systems; Classification tasks; Computation complexity; Computation resources; Evaluation methods; Named entity recognition; NAtural language processing; Systematic literature review; Systematic literature review (SLR); Embeddings

"Detecting Network Intrusion by Combining DBSCAN, Principle Component Analysis and Ranker","The internet technology has grown rapidly, which may cause problems in computer network systems. Intrusion Detection System (IDS) has been introduced for detecting attacks in that system. Using artificial intelligence, Intrusion Detection System will able to recognize anomalies or signatures of attacks. For some years, research has focused on the data mining method for detecting the anomaly to increase the accuracy of classification results. To obtain high accuracy, required several stages of data preparation and feature selection. It because the feature selection are not correlated to the dataset and not accordance with requirement of the classification process. In this research, we perform anomaly detection on IDS using combination of DBSCAN, Principle Component Analysis (PCA) and Ranker with classification method. For evaluation, we employ Kyoto 2006, NSL-KDD 99 and KDD Cup 99 as datasets. It is found that this preprocessing step increases the accuracy, when it is applied to Naïve Bayes, Random Forest and k-NN methods. Specifically, the highest increase of accuracy is achieved by Naïve Bayes Classification method with KDD Cup 1999 which gains 6.11%. © 2019 IEEE.",computer network; Data protection; intrusion detection system; network security Anomaly detection; Classification (of information); Computer crime; Data mining; Decision trees; Feature extraction; Intelligent systems; Intrusion detection; Nearest neighbor search; Network security; Accuracy of classifications; Bayes classification; Classification methods; Classification process; Data mining methods; Intrusion Detection Systems; Pre-processing step; Principle component analysis; Principal component analysis

Advance Reservation for Parametric Job on Grid Computing,"Parametric jobs are similar jobs, differing only in arguments or input/output files. With the parametric type of job, most jobs can send as a single job. In science and engineering, parametric computing becomes very important as a means to explore the behavior of complex systems. Users can request resources to run jobs that they send in the future. The scheduler then looks for the availability of the requested resource in a predetermined time interval. If the required resources are not available, the request rejected. The flexible FCFS-LRH algorithm is proposed to overcome the amount of rejection, from the experimental results for scheduling parametric jobs, and it found that the FCFS-LRH advance reservation algorithm is better than without advance reservation. © 2019 IEEE.",advance Reservation; FCFS-LRH; grid computing; parametric job; scheduling Parameter estimation; Scheduling; Advance reservation; FCFS-LRH; Input/output; parametric job; Science and engineering; Time interval; Grid computing

However, the work still does not consider the presence of PU. In this work, we attempted to generate a new scheme to maximize the network throughput of SU regarding the presence of PU. Modification in the fitness function is aimed to get maximum network throughput and fairly distributed resource. The result is shown by the graph of CDF SIR that the probability value of proposed method obtained better result than the random one. The use of suitable parameters on GA will affects the computational speed and the convergence process in this system program. © 2019 IEEE.",A Modified Genetic Algorithm; Cognitive Radio Network; fairness throughput distribution Genetic algorithms; Radio; Radio systems; Resource allocation; Cognitive radio network; Cognitive radio network (CRN); Computational speed; Convergence process; Distributed resources; fairness throughput distribution; Modified genetic algorithms; Resource allocation schemes; Cognitive radio
