Content-based image retrieval for fabric images: A survey,"In recent years, a great deal of research has been conducted in the area of fabric image retrieval, especially the identification and classification of visual features. One of the challenges associated with the domain of content-based image retrieval (CBIR) is the semantic gap between low-level visual features and high-level human perceptions. Generally, CBIR includes two main components, namely feature extraction and similarity measurement. Therefore, this research aims to determine the content-based image retrieval for fabric using feature extraction techniques grouped into traditional methods and convolutional neural networks (CNN). Traditional descriptors deal with low-level features, while CNN addresses the high-level, called semantic features. Traditional descriptors have the advantage of shorter computation time and reduced system requirements. Meanwhile, CNN descriptors, which handle high-level features tailored to human perceptions, deal with large amounts of data and require a great deal of computation time. In general, the features of a CNN's fully connected layers are used for matching query and database images. In several studies, the extracted features of the CNN's convolutional layer were used for image retrieval. At the end of the CNN layer, hash codes are added to reduce search time. © 2021 Institute of Advanced Engineering and Science.

Autocorrection of lung boundary on 3D CT lung cancer images,"Lung cancer in men has the highest mortality rate among all types of cancer. Juxta-pleural and juxta-vascular are the most common nodules located on the lung surface. A computer aided detection (CADe) system is effective for assisting radiologists in diagnosing lung nodules. However, the lung segmentation step requires sophisticated methods when juxta-pleural and juxta-vascular nodules are present. Fast computational time and low error in covering nodule areas are the aims of this study. The proposed method consists of five stages, namely ground truth (GT) extraction, data preparation, tracheal extraction, separation of lung fusion and lung border correction. The used data consist of 57 3D CT lung cancer images taken from selected LIDC-IDRI dataset. These nodules are determined as the outer areas labeled by four radiologists. The proposed method achieves the fastest computational time of 0.32 s per slice or 60 times faster than that of conventional adaptive border marching (ABM). Moreover, it produces under segmentation of nodule value as low as 14.6%. It indicates that the proposed method has a potential to be embedded in the lung CADe system to cover pleural juxta and vascular nodule areas in lung segmentation. © 2019 The Authors",Boundary correction; CADe system; Lung; Segmentation 
Developing Machine Learning Framework to Classify Harmonized System Code. Case Study: Indonesian Customs,"Directorate General of Customs and Excise (DGCE), an Indonesian Government agency under the Ministry of Finance, is responsible for ensuring importer or exporter classify their declared goods based on the Harmonized System Code (HS Code). This study aims to find an optimal machine learning framework to classify goods into their HS Code based on the challenges DGCE faced, such as mixed language with an inconsistent pattern of goods descriptions, imbalance multiclass HS Code, and some additional categorical variables. Refer to some previous studies that propose some machine learning models to predict the HS Code based on goods descriptions. This study tries to make some improvements and adjustments in line with the previously mentioned challenges faced by DGCE. Some preprocessing tasks were performed, such as dealing with abbreviations, misspellings, the varying pattern of goods description, and translating Indonesian words into English. One Hot Coding (OHC) is applied to encode nominal and categorical variables. To make features from goods descriptions, we choose Term Frequency-Inverse Document Frequency (TF-IDF) combined with bigrams. As a result, our models show that Random Forest got an F1-score of 79.60% when classifying the HS Code's first four digits, and Multinomial NB got an F1-score of 72.74% when classifying the HS Code's entire digits. Compared to the baseline paper, those scores are 11.26% and 11.36% higher, respectively. © 2021 IEEE.",HS code; Indonesian customs; machine learning Decision trees; Machine learning; Optimal systems; Text processing; Categorical variables; F1 scores; Government agencies; Machine learning models; Multinomials; One hot coding; System codes; Term frequencyinverse document frequency (TF-IDF); Codes (symbols)
Suction-based Grasp Point Estimation in Cluttered Environment for Robotic Manipulator Using Deep Learning-based Affordance Map,"Perception and manipulation tasks for robotic manipulators involving highly-cluttered objects have become increasingly in-demand for achieving a more efficient problem solving method in modern industrial environments. But, most of the available methods for performing such cluttered tasks failed in terms of performance, mainly due to inability to adapt to the change of the environment and the handled objects. Here, we propose a new, near real-time approach to suction-based grasp point estimation in a highly cluttered environment by employing an affordance-based approach. Compared to the state-of-the-art, our proposed method offers two distinctive contributions. First, we use a modified deep neural network backbone for the input of the semantic segmentation, to classify pixel elements of the input red, green, blue and depth (RGBD) channel image which is then used to produce an affordance map, a pixel-wise probability map representing the probability of a successful grasping action in those particular pixel regions. Later, we incorporate a high speed semantic segmentation to the system, which makes our solution have a lower computational time. This approach does not need to have any prior knowledge or models of the objects since it removes the step of pose estimation and object recognition entirely compared to most of the current approaches and uses an assumption to grasp first then recognize later, which makes it possible to have an object-agnostic property. The system was designed to be used for household objects, but it can be easily extended to any kind of objects provided that the right dataset is used for training the models. Experimental results show the benefit of our approach which achieves a precision of 88.83%, compared to the 83.4% precision of the current state-of-the-art. © 2021, Institute of Automation, Chinese Academy of Sciences and Springer-Verlag GmbH Germany, part of Springer Nature.",blue and depth (RGBD) channel image; cluttered environment; Grasping point estimation; green; household objects; red; semantic segmentation Deep neural networks; Flexible manipulators; Image segmentation; Industrial manipulators; Industrial robots; Object recognition; Pixels; Problem solving; Robotics; Semantics; Cluttered environments; Computational time; Industrial environments; Manipulation task; Probability maps; Problem Solving methods; Robotic manipulators; Semantic segmentation; Deep learning
Computer aided diagnosis for thyroid cancer system based on internal and external characteristics,"Background and aims: Thyroid cancer is one of the fastest growing cancers worldwide. Thyroid ultrasound images are diagnosed based on several characteristics to determine the malignancy of the nodule. The characteristics are divided into two, i.e. external characteristics and internal characteristics. A computer-aided diagnosis (CADx) is necessary to assist radiologists in analysing these characteristics more objectively. Methods: Firstly, a pre-processing step was applied to remove label and reduce speckle noise by applying adaptive median filter followed by bilateral filter. Secondly, active contour and morphology operation were applied to segment the nodules. Subsequently, geometric and texture features were extracted. In the final step, multilayer perceptron was used to classify internal characteristics while support vector machine was used for classifying external characteristics. Results: The sensitivity, specificity and accuracy of nodule classification based on analysis of external characteristics were 100%, 95.45% and 97.78%, respectively, whereas classification results based on internal characteristics were 95.35%, 90.91% and 94.44%, respectively. Conclusion: A computer-aided diagnosis (CADx) for thyroid cancer system based on analysis of external and internal characteristics has been developed. The sensitivity, specificity and level of accuracy for both characteristics showed that the proposed system was reliable to assist radiologist in classifying thyroid nodules. © 2019 The Authors",Computed aided diagnosis; External characteristics; Internal characteristics; Thyroid cancer 
Analysis of Retinal Nerve Fiber Layer for Classification of Glaucoma,"Glaucoma is the second leading causes of blindness beside of cataracts. In the glaucoma examination, determining the disease is very difficult since the symptoms are difficult to find. The ophthalmologists usually use the disc damage likelihood score (DDLS) in examining the optic nerve damage which is very complicated. Glaucoma can also be detected by looking at damage of retinal nerve fiber layer (RNFL) which is characterized by the loss of nerve fiber around the optic nerve head (ONH). However, manual examination became less effective and less efficient since it required specific skills and needed more time to finish the examination. This research aimed to develop a scheme for detecting glaucoma disease based on retinal nerve fiber layer features. First order statistic feature was used to recognize the characteristic of RNFL. These features were mean, standard deviation, skewness, energy, entropy, smoothness, min and max. The info gain feature selection was used to select features with the most dominant influence. Then, the selected feature was used to classify the image into a normal class or glaucoma. Retinal image classification results between normal class and glaucoma using radial basis function network (RBFN) classifier obtained accuracy of 90.00%, sensitivity of 93.33%, and specificity of 86.67%. These results indicated that the proposed method could assist the ophthalmologist in early detection of glaucoma disease on retinal fundus image based on retinal nerve fiber layer features. © 2021 IEEE.",blindness; glaucoma; RBFN classifier; retina disease; RNFL characteristic Damage detection; Feature extraction; Fibers; Image classification; Ophthalmology; Radial basis function networks; Glaucoma disease; Likelihood score; Nerve damage; Nerve fibers; Network classifiers; Optic nerve; Radial base function network classifier; Retina disease; Retinal nerve fiber layer characteristic; Retinal nerve fiber layers; Eye protection

Night-to-Day Road Scene Translation Using Generative Adversarial Network with Structural Similarity Loss for Night Driving Safety,"Inadequate road infrastructures in developing countries, such as road lighting, is a real life problem affecting their transportation system. A poor road lighting hinders the ability of drivers to perceive the road conditions as well as its objects which may lead to the accident. We address a problem of synthesizing day-time appearance from the night-time road scene using loss-modified generative adversarial network. Our approach basically makes a balance between domain regularization and human perceptual restoration. By taking the night-time image into our enhanced adversarial network, which employs structural similarity loss, we increase its visibility so that the driver can clearly see the road scene like they are driving during the day-time. Experimental results show the benefit of our approach for enhancing the visibility of the night-time view of the road, measured by the image quality metrics. © 2021, The Author(s), under exclusive license to Springer Nature Switzerland AG.",Deep learning; Generative adversarial networks (GAN); Traffic accidents 
Measurement and Classification Retinal Blood Vessel Tortuosity in Digital Fundus Images,"Analysis and detection of retinal blood vessels structure changes is the most important for diagnosing and detecting retinal diseases. Retinal blood vessels are normally straight or curved gently, but they tend to dilate and expand into twisting with age or the number of retinal disease. Tortuosity is a qualitative parameter used by ophthalmologist to show how blood vessels tortuos such as mild, moderate, severe and extreme as the analysis result remain subjective. To establish the relationship between tortuosity and vascular pathology requires quantitative measurement of tortuosity. This research developed a computer aided diagnosis (CAD) to detect retinal blood vessels before measure the blood vessels tortuosity and classify them. A method of morphological reconstruction is proposed to detect retinal blood vessels. Retinal blood vessel tortuosity was calculated using relative length variation method to classify retinal images. This research is conducted two types classification using K nearest neighbor. The first classification is normal and tortuosity classes. The second classification is moderate and severe tortuosity classes. The evaluation result for retinal blood vessel detection is obtained accuracy of 96.2%. Calculation of retinal blood vessel tortuosity based on relative length variation method because it has the best correlation of 0.892 to grading. The results of retinal blood vessel tortuosity classification between normal and tortuosity classes is obtained the best accuracy of KNN by 93%. The classification between moderate and severe tortuosity classes using KNN obtains accuracy of 100%.

Indonesian Sentiment Analysis: An Experimental Study of Four Kernel Functions on SVM Algorithm with TF-IDF,"Recently, Indonesian sentiment analysis is a hot research field, especially for twitter data. Many approaches can be used to classify people's sentiment on Twitter. One of the best methods in sentiment analysis is machine learning. SVM is a machine learning algorithm that has good performance. However, some of the findings of SVM research have different results, which are no better than other algorithms. It is because each study uses a different SVM configuration. Kernel functions on SVM play an essential role in improving SVM performance. Choosing the sui table Kernel function is also crucial for every particular application of SVM. Therefore, to address the problem, we compared four kernel functions on SVM with TF-IDF, such as Polynomial, Sigmoid, Linear, and Radial Basis Function (RBF) kernel. TF-IDF is employed as a feature extraction and selection to improve SVM performance. We used 4000 tweets about omnibus law issues in Indonesia, and 10-fold cross-validation and confusion matrix were employed to validate and evaluate our models. Based on the experimental results, the RBF kernel function on SVM+TF-IDF using 2000 features achieved the best performance of all feature tests in accuracy, precision, recall, and f-measure with value of 96.61%, 96.70%, 96.58%, 96.60%, respectively. Besides, the RBF kernel function obtained high performance when using low dimensionality of the feature. Meanwhile, the Linear kernel function reached the best performance when using high dimensionality of the feature. © 2020 IEEE.",kernel functions; Sentiment Analysis; support vector machine; tf-idf; twitter data Feature extraction; Industrial economics; Machine learning; Sentiment analysis; Social networking (online); Turing machines; 10-fold cross-validation; Confusion matrices; Feature extraction and selection; High dimensionality; Linear kernel functions; Low dimensionality; Radial Basis Function(RBF); RBF kernel function; Learning algorithms

Accuracy Improvement of Object Selection in Gaze Gesture Application using Deep Learning,"Gaze-based interaction is a crucial research area. Gaze gesture provides faster interaction between a user and a computer application because people naturally look at the object of interest before taking any other actions. Spontaneous gaze-gesture-based application uses gaze-gesture as an input modality without performing any calibration. The conventional eye tracking systems have a problem with low accuracy. In general, data captured by eye tracker contains errors and noise within gaze position signal. The errors and noise affect the performance of object selection in gaze gesture based application that controls digital contents on the display using smooth-pursuit eye movement. The conventional object selection method suffers from low accuracy (<80%). In this paper, we addressed this accuracy problem with a novel approach using deep learning. We exploited deep learning power to recognize the pattern of eye-gaze data. Long Short Term Memory (LSTM) is a deep learning architecture based on recurrent neural network (RNN). We used LSTM to perform object selection task. The dataset consisted of 34 participants taken from previous study of object selection technique of gaze gesture-based application. Our experimental results show that the proposed method achieved 96.17% of accuracy. In future, our result may be used as a guidance for developing gaze gesture application. © 2020 IEEE.",Deep Learning; Eye Tracking; Gaze Gesture; LSTM Eye movements; Eye tracking; Long short-term memory; Accuracy Improvement; Accuracy problems; Eye tracking systems; Gaze-based interaction; Input modalities; Learning architectures; Recurrent neural network (RNN); Smooth pursuit eye movement; Deep learning
Sliding variance and data range for lightweight sports activity recognition with fusion of modalities,"This research develops a novel lightweight sport activity detection system using time series data of the accelerometer sensors embedded in two modalities, the smartphone and smartwatch. This research focuses on the lightweight exercises, more specifically, jumping jack, push up, sit up, and squat jump. Such activities are chosen for two reasons; the smartphone is now accessible for many persons, and the lightweight exercises are deemed to be easily completed in daily basis for everyone. Our proposed algorithm includes two novel feature extraction methods, i.e. sliding variance and data range, combined with a digital filter and data clipping methods. The results of feature extraction processes were classified using a combination of k-NN and DTW algorithms. The classification results are subsequently compared with the-state-of-the-art algorithms, i.e. LMNN and Naïve Bayes algorithms. The final results imply the merge of k-NN and DTW algorithms (k = 1) with data range method achieves the highest accuracy. The average accuracy for this method is 97.4%, with the processing time of 0.86 s. Thus, the result of counting activity method was acceptable with average values 80% for the whole movement by using two sensor accelerometers. © 2018 The Authors",Dynamic Time Warping; kNearest Neighbor; Large Margin Nearest Neighbor; Lightweight sport activity; Naïve Bayes 
Application of Artificial Potential Field for Coverage Control with Collision Avoidance Under Sensing Constraints,"In multi-agent coverage control, the Voronoi diagram optimization strategy is widely used. However, the limitation of sensing radius makes Voronoi diagram optimization strategy not suitable to implement. Moreover, when the agent’s dimension and obstacles are considered, the Voronoi diagram cannot deal further due to the collision that may occur. Considering these limitations, power diagram optimization strategy is used. To deal with obstacles, artificial potential field strategy is combined with the power diagram. Despite its simplicity, the numerical study shows that the proposed scheme of coverage control works well under sensing constraints even with the presence of obstacles. The proposed strategy is convergent to the objective without collision with obstacles as well as among the agents. © 2020, Brazilian Society for Automatics--SBA.",Artificial potential field; Coverage control; Obstacle avoidance; Power diagram; Voronoi diagram Computational geometry; Graphic methods; Multi agent systems; Artificial potential fields; Collision with obstacle; Coverage control; Optimization strategy; Power diagrams; Sensing constraints; Sensing radius; Voronoi diagrams; Collision avoidance
Automated Detection of Plasmodium Ovale and Malariae Species on Microscopic Thin Blood Smear Images,"Malaria is caused by Plasmodium and transmitted by female Anopheles mosquitoes bite. Early detection of malaria has been performed using microscopic thin blood smear images. Even so, in 2014, as many as 321 million times microscopic examination, there were frequent misdiagnosis caused by human factors. Region of Interest (RoI) in image processing is part of the image that has the highest information. The precise determination of the RoI area can make the computer-based identification process work more efficiently, contribute better to the system, and also eliminate objects that are perceived to interfere with the whole process. This study aims to detect parasites by determining the RoI area of two species of Plasmodium Ovale and Plasmodium Malariae. The working principle of detection is using adaptive thresholding, colour segmentation between green channel (G) with hue channel (H) from HSV colour space, and some morphological operation techniques. The data used are digital microscopic images of thin blood smear. This research achieves the sensitivity level of 91.6% and positive predictive value (PPV) of 89.1%.

Enumeration of Plasmodium Parasites on Thin Blood Smear Digital Microscopic Images,"An automated parasite detection is one of the challenges in computer vision and medicine field. Recently, an automated detection system became necessary in order to assist the parasitologist in detecting parasite. However, the development of automated parasite detection had several challenges. Mostly, previous research studies were conducted with the homogeny dataset. Hence, it will become a problem if the research was conducted with various dataset. According to those facts, this study proposed a scheme for detecting Plasmodium parasites. In this study, 46 thin blood smear digital microscopic images of Plasmodium Falciparum with several kinds of pixel intensity were used. The proposed method started by normalizing the data. The normalization result was then segmented by using Otsu thresholding and some operations of morphological operation. Based on the segmentation result, parasite candidate detection was done by storing the location of an object in segmentation result and labeling the object by using BLOB analysis. The result of detection process produced high number of false positive. To reduce the number of false positive, feature extraction process followed by classification process was conducted. Several texture features such as histogram, GLCM and GLRLM were used to extract information of parasite. Classification process was conducted by applying several kernels of SVM classifier. According to the evaluation process, the proposed method has better performance than previous study and successfully distinguish parasite and non-parasite by using the cubic kernel of SVM with accuracy, sensitivity, specificity, PPV and NPV of 97.4%, 100%, 94.8%, 95.1% and 100%, respectively. These results indicated that the proposed scheme is proper in order to assist the expert in detecting Plasmodium parasites effectively. © 2019 IEEE.",detection algorithm; malaria; microscopic images; Plasmodium parasites Automation; Blood; Embedded systems; Mathematical morphology; Support vector machines; Textures; Classification process; Detection algorithm; Digital microscopic images; malaria; Microscopic image; Morphological operations; Plasmodium falciparum; Plasmodium parasites; Classification (of information)

Deep learning-based Anomaly Detection on Surveillance Videos: Recent Advances,"Surveillance cameras number keep increasing from year to year, in 2017 alone estimated 106 million new CCTV installed. Surveillance cameras are installed to widen surveillance coverage in order to detect anomalies. Conventionally, detecting anomalies through surveillance cameras are using human observers. The increasing number of surveillance cameras installed is increasing the need for an automatic system to replace unreliable human observer. Thus an intelligent computer vision-based system to detect anomalies need to be developed. The goal of this system is to provide a warning to the first responder accurately and as fast as possible while the system is running all the time. The faster the response of the first responder, the better chance of an anomaly to be resolved. Deep learning based method has been proposed to solve anomaly detection on videos. Anomaly detected is composed of a set of violent and non-violent crimes with high impact in society. To increase the accuracy of previous system to detect anomalies in condition that resembles real life situation, multiple processes need to be combined.

User profile correlation-based similarity (UPCSim) algorithm in movie recommendation system,"Collaborative filtering is one of the most widely used recommendation system approaches. One issue in collaborative filtering is how to use a similarity algorithm to increase the accuracy of the recommendation system. Most recently, a similarity algorithm that combines the user rating value and the user behavior value has been proposed. The user behavior value is obtained from the user score probability in assessing the genre data. The problem with the algorithm is it only considers genre data for capturing user behavior value. Therefore, this study proposes a new similarity algorithm – so-called User Profile Correlation-based Similarity (UPCSim) – that examines the genre data and the user profile data, namely age, gender, occupation, and location. All the user profile data are used to find the weights of the similarities of user rating value and user behavior value. The weights of both similarities are obtained by calculating the correlation coefficients between the user profile data and the user rating or behavior values. An experiment shows that the UPCSim algorithm outperforms the previous algorithm on recommendation accuracy, reducing MAE by 1.64% and RMSE by 1.4%. © 2021, The Author(s).",Collaborative filtering; UPCSim; User behavior value; User rating value 
Recommendation algorithm using clustering-based upcsim (Cb-upcsim),"One of the well-known recommendation systems is memory-based collaborative filtering that utilizes similarity metrics. Recently, the similarity metrics have taken into account the user rating and user behavior scores. The user behavior score indicates the user preference in each product type (genre). The added user behavior score to the similarity metric results in more complex com-putation. To reduce the complex computation, we combined the clustering method and user behavior score-based similarity. The clustering method applies k-means clustering by determination of the number of clusters using the Silhouette Coefficient. Whereas the user behavior score-based similarity utilizes User Profile Correlation-based Similarity (UPCSim). The experimental results with the MovieLens 100k dataset showed a faster computation time of 4.16 s. In addition, the Mean Ab-solute Error (MAE) and Root Mean Square Error (RMSE) values decreased by 1.88% and 1.46% com-pared to the baseline algorithm. © 2021 by the authors.

Designing a tourism recommendation system using a hybrid method (Collaborative Filtering and Content-Based Filtering),"A recommendation system is an application model based on observations of the customers circumstances and desires. The recommendation system can be applied in various fields, one of which is tourism. By utilizing a recommendation system, tourism can introduce and promote its tourism to the wider community. In the recommendation system, several methods are used to support how the system works in producing information. This papers uses the Hybrid (Collaborative Filtering Content-Based Filtering) method and the Nearest Neighbor (NN) algorithm. This method has a weakness when an item does not have a rating at all. Therefore, it needs a method that can overcome the weaknesses of the method. We implement a hybrid method, which combines several methods in the recommendation system to produce recommendation items under the users wishes. In addition, this system will use Whatsapp Messenger as a promotional medium.

Automated Item Generation: Model and Development Technique,"The development of Computer Assisted Assessment (CAA) has helped the assessment process. Some of the advantages offered by these tools are effectivity and speed. But there are still obstacles in the process of compiling the items. Therefore, we need tools to overcome this problem. Automated Item Generation (AIG) is a tool to generate questions using computer devices. Several models and techniques in AIG had been developed. AIG research is grouped into 2 models i.e. the framework model and special model. In the previous study, the AIG was divided into two approaches, automatic and semi-automatic. Several techniques were developed to produce high-quality and variety of items. Each technique has advantages and disadvantages in generating items. Thus, there is still a need for developing AIG to answer the challenges that have not been resolved in the previous study. This paper presents a literature review to identify a specific problem in each model and technique especially for mathematic and non-verbal items, validity and reliability of the items, and the schema or infrastructure presented to generate the items. This paper also gives possible suggestions on how to make an improvement the items generated to be better in the future. © 2020 IEEE.",AIG Model; AIG Technique; Automated Item Generation; Computer Assisted Assessment Computer science; Computers; Electrical engineering; Mathematical techniques; Assessment process; Computer assisted assessment; Computer device; Development technique; Framework models; Literature reviews; Semi-automatics; Specific problems; Automation
Automatic Question Generator System Conceptual Model for Mathematic and Geometry Parallel Question Replication,"Weaknesses in the paper assessment process have been able to overcome using the Computer Assisted Assessment (CAA) objective question. The weakness that can be overcome is the reduction in time for correction and the process of handling thousands of participants simultaneously. However, the process of preparing objective questions is still constrained by providing parallel questions. Parallel questions are made so that each examinee gets a different question but has the same level of difficulty. Making parallel questions manually requires expensive costs and the consistency of the difficulty level must be the same. Some researchers propose an Automatic Question Generation (AQG) system to overcome these problems. In this study an AQG system will be developed to make parallel questions for the material tested at each school level. The process of previous generating questions that can only detect text and numeric variables, will be developed so that they can detect image variables and can detect geometry types based on numerical variables. The system is expected to work like humans who can make questions when given a text, numeric, image, or mathematical notation. By combining the Stem, Multi Part Parser Algorithm and the Custom Media Type Parser Algorithm in the Python-Django framework, the system can provide question recommendations according to mathematical geometry-based input. The process of generating items in this study will use the concept of manipulation of keywords represented by variables. This variable stores values in the form of text, numeric, and image. The ability to manipulate text, numerics, and images is applied to the developed AQG system so that it can be used to generate questions on the material to be tested. AQG is expected to be able to detect text, numeric, notation, and image input and produce output in the form of geometry-based mathematical problems according to text, numeric, notation, and image input with a better level of accuracy. © 2020 IOP Publishing Ltd.

Improving Money Laundering Detection Using Optimized Support Vector Machine,"Identification of financial transactions as suspicious or fraudulent transactions that are indicated as money laundering is mostly done manually so that it is not optimal. Data mining techniques can be a solution to overcome the limitations of the manual method. The main challenge in applying data mining techniques for financial fraud detection is an imbalanced dataset, where the proportion of fraud class is much smaller than non-fraud. This causes the model to produce unbalanced precision and recall, resulting in a low f1score. It means that the model can predict one class well, but not with another class. In this paper, the approach to fraud detection in financial transactions is carried out with classifier optimization based on Support Vector Machine (SVM). Optimization is performed by tuning the kernels and hyperparameters combined with the Random Under Sampling (RUS) technique. Specifically, RUS is used to handle imbalanced datasets and cut model training time. With this combination technique, the classifier can detect fraud more effectively with an increase in precision of 40.82% and f1-score of 22.79% compared to the previous study. A combination technique can be an approach to cover weaknesses left behind by a single method. © 2019 IEEE.",Anti Money Laundering; Data Mining; Fraud Detection; RUS; SVM Classifier Crime; Finance; Intelligent systems; Laundering; Support vector machines; Financial fraud detections; Financial transactions; Fraudulent transactions; Imbalanced Data-sets; Imbalanced dataset; Money laundering; Precision and recall; Random under samplings; Data mining
Dropout Prediction Optimization through SMOTE and Ensemble Learning,"Dropout rates on Massive Open Online Courses (MOOCs) are still very high. One effort to reduce the number of dropouts is by interfering at-risk students. An accurate and high consistency prediction system is needed. Machine learning method is the most popular in handling this case. The focus of machine learning that ensures the ability of models in generalizing knowledge makes overfitting a critical issue in supervised learning. Thus, a single classifier may fail to classify correctly. Besides, the inherent class imbalance between dropout (majority class) and non-dropout (minority) makes it difficult to build robust predictions. To overcome this problem, an ensemble learning (EL) is combined with synthetic minority over-sampling technique (SMOTE). The SMOTE-Ensemble Learning (SEL) is done by majority voting from three base machine learning methods: Logistic Regression (LR), K-Nearest Neighbor (KNN) and Random Forest (RF). The result on the KDDCUP2015 dataset shows that this combination able to improve prediction performance with an average improvement of the harmonic mean of precision and recall (F1-score): 7.74% compared to previous work. © 2019 IEEE.",Dropout Prediction; Ensemble Learning; KDDCUP2015; Massive Open Online Courses; SMOTE Decision trees; Intelligent systems; Logistic regression; Machine learning; Nearest neighbor search; K nearest neighbor (KNN); Machine learning methods; Massive open online course; Precision and recall; Prediction performance; Prediction systems; Robust predictions; Synthetic minority over-sampling techniques; Forecasting
Development and evaluation of adaptive metacognitive scaffolding for algorithm-learning system,"Adaptive metacognitive scaffolding is developed to provide learning assistance on an as-needed basis; thus, advances the effectiveness of computer-based learning systems. Metacognitive scaffoldings have been developed for some science subjects; however, not for algorithm-learning. The learning algorithm is different from learning science as it is more oriented to problem-solving; therefore, this study is aimed to describe the modelling, development, and evaluation of the adaptive metacognitive scaffolding which is dedicated for encouraging algorithm-learning. In addition, the authors present a new approach for learner modelling to find students' metacognitive state. Adaptivity of the scaffolding is based on the learner modelling. To evaluate the effectiveness of the developed system, it is deployed in a real algorithm-learning classroom of 38 students. The class is randomly divided into two groups: experiment and control. Two parameters are measured from both groups, i.e. academic success and academic satisfaction. Non-parametric statistical test, i.e. Mann-Whitney U-test (significance level 0.01) rejects the null hypothesis (U-value = 86.5 and U-critical = 101). This result verifies that the academic success of the experiment group is significantly higher than that of the control group. In addition, an academic satisfaction survey shows that adaptive scaffolding is valid in assisting students while learning with the system. © The Institution of Engineering and Technology 2018.", Learning systems; Scaffolds; Statistical tests; Students; Algorithm learning; Computer-based learning systems; Learning science; Mann-Whitney U test; Metacognitive scaffoldings; Non-parametric statistical tests; Null hypothesis; Significance levels; Learning algorithms
Sentiment analysis on product review using support vector machine (SVM),"Public opinion can influence an organization or a company profile. It is important for the company to evaluate public response regarding their products. However, monitoring and organizing of public opinion are not easy. There are many published opinions in social media that is difficult to be processed manually. Therefore, a technique for automatically categorizing public reviews into positive or negative is needed. This research examined the classification of user reviews on products Windows Phone by implementing Support Vector Machine (SVM). This study used four different methods in tokenization stage: unigram, bigram, trigram, and n-gram. In the preprocessing data, there were 8 experiments whereas each group implemented 2 stemming algorithms (Snowball Stemmer and Iterated-Lovin Stemmer). The results were used as input of classification. Each input was classified 3 times with values C 0.25, 0.5, and 1.0. In conclusion, the result yielded the most appropriate model from n-gram with algorithm Iterated-Lovin Stemmer and C value 1.0. Finally, the use of SVM proves to be feasible approach of sentiment analysis regarding specific product. © 2019 IEEE.",Bigram; N-gram; Sentiment analysis; Support vector machine; Trigram; Unigram Sentiment analysis; Social aspects; Appropriate models; Company profile; Product reviews; Public opinions; Public review; Stemming algorithms; Tokenization; Windows phones; Support vector machines
What is informatics education students’impression of using metacognitive training system at the first time?,"The use of Metacognitive Training System (MTS) is relatively new in Indonesia. Previously, a prototype of MTS has been developed and applied in Universitas Gadjah Mada. To become a massive product, the prototype of the MTS must be tested on a larger scale. It is intended to capture user impression about a new product. In this paper, we present User Experience (UX) measurement for the developed MTS in larger scale, involving 90 undergraduate students of informatics education at Universitas Negeri Malang. Two UX measurement methods are used, including User Experience Questionnaires (UEQ) and short-interview. UEQ is used for capturing general impressions, whereas, short-interview is conducted to get deeper feedback about the efficacy of the MTS in their studies. The UX measurement result is benchmarked and revealed that Attractiveness, Efficiency, and Stimulation categorized excellent and the interview result shows that more than 75% respondent responds with the positive answer in five questions. With this result, it could be concluded that the MTS is ready for massive product. © 2018 IEEE.",Metacognitive training system; Student impression; User experience Informatics; Information systems; Information use; Surveys; Indonesia; Informatics education; Measurement methods; Metacognitives; Training Systems; Undergraduate students; User experience; User experiences (ux); Students
User-centered design on metacognitive training system: A case in algorithm and data structure course,"Metacognitive training system (MTS) is a computer-based learning system aimed at developing students' metacognition. Metacognition is needed to develop students' self-regulation which is required for learning complex topics such as algorithm and data structure (ADS). Previously, we develop an MTS to support algorithm-learning. However, the approach tends to be technology-centered, thus, producing low usability score. Therefore, this paper proposes an incorporation of user-centered design (UCD) into the development of the MTS to produce a more usable system. As a result, new information architecture, wireframe, and user interface design are obtained. Finally, the system usability testing is conducted to compare two versions of the MTS, i.e. older and newer version. The result shows that the newer version has higher usability scale. In addition, the newer version of the MTS shows a positive impact on a real learning situation, indicated by the significant difference on students' performance between control and experiment group. © 2018 IEEE.",Algorithm and data structure; Metacognitive training system; User interface design; User-centered design Cognitive systems; Curricula; Data structures; Learning algorithms; Software design; Students; User centered design; Algorithm learning; Computer-based learning systems; Information architectures; Learning situation; Students' performance; Training Systems; User Centered Design(UCD); User interface designs; User interfaces
A Framework for Improving Recommendation in Adaptive Metacognitive Scaffolding,"Metacognitive scaffolding is an important pedagogical support to encourage self-regulated learning, especially in computer-based learning environments. Currently, an e-learning system which is complemented by metacognitive scaffolding has been developed. The scaffolding includes a recommendation system given by a virtual pedagogical agent. However, an academic satisfaction evaluation on the system reveals that the recommendation is less helpful. Therefore, this paper proposes a framework for providing a better recommendation. Two types of recommendations are aimed, including recommendation for the definition of learning goal/sub-goal and learning strategy. Goal/sub-goal recommendation is generated by identifying students' level of prior knowledge by using text classification algorithm. On the other hand, the strategy-use recommendation is generated by modeling the fitness of previously used learning strategy using fuzzy inference system and analyzing students' interaction log with the learning strategy. Implementation of the proposed scheme produces a prototype of the recommendation system. An A/B testing is conducted to compare previous and newer recommendation systems. The test shows that most of the users prefer to use the improved recommendation system. © 2018 IEEE.",algorithm learning; fuzzy inference system; metacognitive scaffolding; recommendation; student modeling Classification (of information); Computer aided instruction; E-learning; Fuzzy inference; Fuzzy systems; Inference engines; Learning systems; Scaffolds; Students; Text processing; Algorithm learning; Fuzzy inference systems; Metacognitive scaffoldings; recommendation; Student Modeling; Recommender systems
Tahani model of fuzzy database for an adaptive metacognitive scaffolding in Hypermedia Learning Environment (Case: Algorithm and structure data course),"Studies show that an adaptive learning environment is needed by learners. Adaptive e-learning systems have been developed with personalized instructions based on student's knowledge level. Since each student has a unique cognitive and metacognitive level, we currently develop an adaptive Hypermedia Learning Environment (HLE) for Algorithm and Data Structure Course based on a metacognitive awareness level. HLE provides adaptive scaffolding as instructional interventions to facilitate students' aptitude in programming. Scaffolding can be determined by knowing student's metacognitive awareness level. In this research, we propose the use of Tahani Model of Fuzzy Database in web-based HLE to support the adaptive decision-making. Tahani is one of some feasible models in a fuzzy database that can categorize students' metacognitive awareness level. The produced fuzzy rules have been validated by metacognitive experts of educational psychology. A hundred students have been categorized into three groups (low, medium, high) and provided with appropriate scaffolding. Evaluation results verified the suitability of the proposed method and the student's scaffolding. © 2017 IEEE.",adaptive; e-learning; fuzzy database; metacognitive; scaffolding; Tahani model Adaptive systems; Database systems; Decision making; E-learning; Fuzzy inference; Hypermedia systems; Learning algorithms; Learning systems; Scaffolds; Students; Sustainable development; adaptive; Adaptive e-learning systems; Adaptive hypermedia learning; Adaptive learning environment; Fuzzy database; Hypermedia learning environments; Metacognitives; scaffolding; Computer aided instruction

Enhancing student clustering to generate adaptive metacognitive instructions in learning system for vocational high school,"Adaptivity in learning systems depends on accuracy of learner modelling. Specifically, for generating cluster-based instructions, quality of student clustering is critical. Studies on student clustering are abundant; however, a system for clustering metacognitive that considers proper analysis technique of Likert-scaled dataset is unavailable. This article proposes a student clustering method which uses a new Likert scale analysis. It is performed on a dataset collected from 81 students of a vocational high school. The performance was compared to previous methods; enhancement is shown by higher silhouette-index and strong correlation with work readiness score. To evaluate the clustering effectiveness, it is implemented on an e-learning system to generate adaptive instructions. The e-learning system is a supplement for fundamental programming course in the school. The t-test result shows that learning gain of experiment group is significantly higher that of the control group. Therefore, the proposed method is effective in improving students' learning quality.

Semi-supervised learning approach for Indonesian Named Entity Recognition (NER) using co-training algorithm,"The problem of utilizing machine learning approach in Indonesian Named Entity Recognition (NER) system is the limited amount of labelled data for training process. However, unlike the limited availability of labelled data, unlabelled data is widely available from many sources. This enables a semi-supervised learning approach to solve this NER system problem. This research aims to design a semi-supervised learning model to solve NER system problem. A semi-supervised co-training learning is used to utilize unlabelled data in NER learning process to produce new labelled data that can be applied to enhance a new NER classi□cation system. This research uses two kinds of data, Indonesian DBPedia data as labelled data and news article text from Indonesian news sites (kompas.com, cnnindonesia.com, tempo.co, merdeka.com and viva.co.id) as unlabelled data. The pre-processing steps applied to analyze unstructured text are sentence segmentation, tokenization, stemming, and PoS Tagging. The results of this pre-process are the NER and its context used as unlabelled data for the semi-supervised co-training process. The SVM algorithm is used as a classi□cation algorithm in this process. 10 Cross Fold Validation is used as the system testing approach. Based on the result of the NER testing system, the precision is 73.6%, the recall is 80.1% and f1 mean is 76.5%. © 2016 IEEE.",Bahasa Indonesia; Co-Training; F1Score; Labelled Data; NER; Precision; Recall; Semi-Supervised Learning; SVM; Un-labelled Data Computational linguistics; Learning algorithms; Learning systems; Natural language processing systems; Positive ions; Problem solving; Co-training; F1 scores; Indonesia; Labelled Data; Precision; Recall; Semi- supervised learning; Un-labelled Data; Supervised learning
